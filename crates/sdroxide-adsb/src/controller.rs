//! Threading wrapper around the decoder, mirroring
//! [`sdroxide_ism::IsmController`]: the realtime engine thread ships window-rate
//! I/Q over a bounded channel (dropping on backpressure) and drains results
//! non-blocking through [`AdsbController::poll`]. The correlator, the slicer and
//! the aircraft table all run on the worker.
//!
//! Control traffic rides a separate unbounded channel for the same reason it
//! does in the skimmer and the ISM decoder: a retune or an off-switch must never
//! be dropped behind a backed-up I/Q queue, which is exactly when it is most
//! likely to be sent.
//!
//! # Why the whole table goes out every time
//!
//! Two hundred and forty samples a second reach this decoder per aircraft in
//! view, and a status message every half second carries all of them at once.
//! Forwarding decodes individually would be a message per squitter — several
//! hundred a second on a busy sector — each of which the panel would have to
//! fold into a table it is already keeping. The snapshot does that folding once,
//! on the worker, and has the property every snapshot has: a dropped one costs
//! nothing, because the next carries the same information.
//!
//! # The stream clock
//!
//! The worker counts samples rather than reading the wall clock for anything
//! that has to be monotonic and fine-grained — the CPR pairing window and the
//! derived turn rate. At a known sample rate that count *is* a clock, it cannot
//! jump, it does not care how the engine is scheduling blocks, and it makes the
//! decoder's arithmetic exactly reproducible from a recording.
