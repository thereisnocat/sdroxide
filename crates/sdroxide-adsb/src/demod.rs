//! The 1090 MHz pulse-position demodulator: complex baseband in, candidate
//! Mode S messages out.
//!
//! # The waveform
//!
//! Mode S downlink (ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV, RTCA DO-260B) is on-off keying at
//! one megabit a second, and every reply has the same two parts:
//!
//! * an **8 µs preamble** — 0.5 µs pulses beginning at 0.0, 1.0, 3.5 and
//!   4.5 µs, with everything between and after them dark until the data
//!   starts. The odd spacing is the point: it is a pattern noise does not make.
//! * a **data block** of either 56 or 112 bits, each bit 1 µs long and split
//!   into two half-microsecond chips. Energy in the first chip is a `1`, energy
//!   in the second is a `0`. Which length it is comes from the first five bits,
//!   the downlink format: 16 and above are the long ones.
//!
//! So a short reply is 8 + 56 = 64 µs and a long one 120 µs, and everything
//! this module does is measured in microseconds rather than in samples.
//!
//! # Why it is written in microseconds, and why the positions are fractional
//!
//! There is no resampler in front of this. The engine hands over whatever its
//! downconverter settled on — 2.4 Msps from an RTL-SDR, 2.025 from an RX-888's
//! wideband path, 2.5 from an Airspy — and the decoder works in *time*, not in
//! samples: [`Demod::chip`] integrates the envelope over the half-microsecond
//! window a chip actually occupies, wherever that falls between samples.
//!
//! That last part is not a refinement, it is the whole thing working or not.
//! A transponder's burst arrives at an arbitrary moment, so the chip boundaries
//! fall wherever they like relative to the sample grid. Round them to the
//! nearest sample and the error is up to half a sample — which at two samples
//! per bit is **half a chip**, and half the bits in the message get decided on
//! the wrong side. Measured, on clean full-scale bursts swept across one sample
//! period: 5 % recovered at 2.025 Msps, 53 % at 2.4, against 100 % above 4.
//! Everything below 4 Msps was effectively broken, and the front end most
//! people point at 1090 MHz runs at 2.4.
//!
//! So the correlator searches at half-sample steps, refines the burst's start
//! time to a sixteenth of a sample against the preamble, and slices with
//! fractional windows from there.
//!
//! # Power, not magnitude
//!
//! Every comparison this module makes is between two envelope levels, and
//! `a > b` has the same answer for `|z|` as for `|z|²`. So the hot path squares
//! and never takes a root; the one square root per accepted message is in
//! [`Candidate::rssi_dbfs`], where a decibel is actually wanted.
//!
//! # Blocks are not messages
//!
//! A long reply is 120 µs — about 288 samples at 2.4 Msps — and the engine's
//! blocks are not aligned to anything. [`Demod::push`] therefore keeps the tail
//! of the previous block in front of the new one, so a message that straddles a
//! boundary is still seen whole. Dropping those would not look like a bug; it
//! would look like a receiver a few decibels deaf.
