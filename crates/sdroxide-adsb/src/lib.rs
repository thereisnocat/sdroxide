//! The 1090 MHz ADS-B / Mode S decoder: reads the surveillance downlink every
//! civil aircraft transmits and reports one row per aircraft, with its identity,
//! altitude, velocity and position (issue #160).
//!
//! Native-only, like the skimmers and the ISM decoder: it runs in the engine off
//! the raw I/Q and reaches the UI as [`sdroxide_types::AdsbStatus`] over the
//! ordinary event path.
//!
//! # Shape of the thing
//!
//! ```text
//! 2+ Msps I/Q  ──►  envelope  ──►  preamble correlator  ──►  chip slicer
//!                                                                 │ 7 or 14 bytes
//!                       aircraft table ◄── CRC / address match ◄───┘
//! ```
//!
//! [`demod`] finds and slices messages; [`crc`] and [`frame`] decide which of
//! them may be believed, and on what grounds; [`message`] says what a believed
//! one contains; [`cpr`] turns the position fields into coordinates; [`track`]
//! folds everything into one entry per aircraft. `controller` wraps the lot in
//! a worker thread.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! All of it is written from the published standards — ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV
//! (the downlink formats, the field layouts and the check sequence), RTCA
//! DO-260B Appendix A (the extended-squitter payloads) and ICAO Doc 9871
//! D.2.4.7 (the position algorithms) — and cited per module. It was
//! cross-checked against `dump1090`'s behaviour and against the frames the
//! standards publish, but no code came from it, which also keeps that project's
//! GPL-2.0 out of the tree.
//!
//! `rsadsb`'s `adsb_deku` was the intended dependency for the message layer and
//! turned out not to build: its last release is pinned by construction to a
//! version of `deku` that has since been yanked, and the one that replaced it
//! rejects the macro attributes `adsb_deku` uses. See this crate's `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! # The receiver this needs
//!
//! Mode S is one megabit a second and every bit is two half-microsecond chips,
//! so what matters is how many samples land inside a chip. The stream has to be
//! at least [`sdroxide_types::ADSB_MIN_RATE_HZ`] and centred near
//! [`sdroxide_types::ADSB_FREQ_HZ`]; neither can be manufactured downstream,
//! because the engine's downconverter decimates and does not interpolate.
//!
//! Between that floor and [`sdroxide_types::ADSB_GOOD_RATE_HZ`] the decoder
//! runs but is *degraded*, and not through any shortcoming of the
//! implementation: at 2 Msps a chip and a sample are the same width, so a burst
//! arriving out of step with the sample clock has its chips split equally
//! between two samples that then read identically. Strong aircraft decode and
//! the rest are lost. Above the good rate every arrival phase decodes — see
//! [`demod`], which measures both.
//!
//! Where a receiver cannot do it at all, the answer is
//! [`sdroxide_types::AdsbStatus::unavailable`] — a sentence the operator can act
//! on — rather than a decoder that runs and finds nothing. Where it can run but
//! only just, it is
//! [`sdroxide_types::AdsbStatus::degraded`], for the same reason.
