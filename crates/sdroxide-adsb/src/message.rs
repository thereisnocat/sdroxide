//! What a Mode S reply says: the field layouts, from the published standard.
//!
//! Written from ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV (3.1.2.6 for the surveillance replies,
//! 3.1.2.8.6 for the extended squitter) and RTCA DO-260B Appendix A (the ME
//! payloads), which between them fix every bit position below. Nothing here is
//! ported from an existing decoder.
//!
//! # The shape of a reply
//!
//! Five bits of downlink format, then a body whose layout that format chooses,
//! then 24 bits of parity ([`crate::crc`]). Short replies are 56 bits, long ones
//! 112; the format decides which, and formats 16 and above are the long ones.
//!
//! Two field encodings recur and are handled once here:
//!
//! * **AC** — an altitude, 13 bits in a surveillance reply and 12 in a position
//!   squitter (the same field without its metric flag).
//! * **ID** — a Mode A identity, 13 bits, interleaved as C1 A1 C2 A2 C4 A4 X
//!   B1 D1 B2 D2 B4 D4 for reasons that date from pulse-position Mode A radar.
//!
//! # Deliberately not decoded
//!
//! **The 100-foot Gillham altitude encoding.** An AC field with its Q bit clear
//! is a Gray-coded altitude in hundred-foot steps, used above 50 175 feet and by
//! a few older transponders. It is not implemented, so an aircraft using it
//! shows no altitude rather than a wrong one; everything civil below the
//! flight levels where it matters uses the 25-foot encoding that is.
//!
//! **The metric altitude encoding** (AC with its M bit set), for the same
//! reason: it is provided for in the standard and used by nothing.
//!
//! **Target state and status (TC 29) and operational status (TC 31).** They
//! carry selected altitude, autopilot modes and integrity figures — real
//! information, but none of it belongs on a target list, and every field would
//! be another thing claimed without a way to check it.
