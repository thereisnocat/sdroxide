//! The aircraft table: accepted frames in, one row per ICAO address out.
//!
//! Everything an aircraft says arrives in pieces — the callsign every five
//! seconds, the altitude and position twice a second in alternating even/odd
//! halves, the velocity in its own message, the squawk only in an answer to an
//! interrogation. This module is where those pieces are folded into one picture
//! per address, and where the two ages that govern a target's life on screen
//! are kept.
//!
//! # Positions
//!
//! A position squitter is a position modulo a grid ([`crate::cpr`]). The first
//! fix for an aircraft needs an even and an odd frame close together; every fix
//! after that comes from a single frame decoded locally against the previous
//! one, which is both faster and what keeps a target moving through the gaps
//! where half the frames are lost. Surface positions are local-only and fall
//! back to the operator's own position as the reference, which is the right
//! answer in practice: an aircraft on the ground is at an airport.
//!
//! # The turn rate is derived, not received
//!
//! Nothing in ADS-B broadcasts rate of turn. The leader line on the map is
//! supposed to curve the way the aircraft is curving, so this module
//! differentiates successive track angles over a few seconds and low-passes the
//! result. It is measured against a clock taken from the *sample stream* rather
//! than from the wall, so it is exactly reproducible in a test and unaffected
//! by however the engine happens to be scheduling blocks.
