//! **Vendored from rax25 `src/state.rs`** — see `vendor/rax25/PROVENANCE.md`.
//! Kept as close to upstream as it can be, including its tests and its
//! commentary on the specification's bugs, because that commentary is the most
//! valuable thing in the file and the hardest to reconstruct.
//!
//! Changes: `anyhow` becomes [`crate::Ax25Error`], `log` becomes `tracing` (the
//! tree's logger), and the type imports follow this crate's module split. The
//! state machine itself is untouched.
//!
//! State machine code for AX.25
//!
//! The state machine is documented in <https://www.tapr.org/pdf/AX25.2.2.pdf>,
//! but it has a few bugs. They're pointed out in the code as they are
//! encountered.
//!
//! There's also the 2017 version, but it quite possibly added more bugs than it
//! fixed:
//! <https://wiki.oarc.uk/_media/packet:ax25.2.2.10.pdf>
//!
//! All page numbers, unless otherwise specified, are for the 1998 PDF.
//!
//! There's also isomer's useful notes at the top of
