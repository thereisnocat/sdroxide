//! ELAD CAT (ASCII, `;`-terminated) — the FDM-DUO and FDM-DUOr. Frequency
//! `FA<11 digits>;`, mode `MD<x>;`, PTT `TX;`/`RX;`.
//!
//! ELAD's own description is "proprietary commands and also a subset of the
//! Kenwood TS-480 command set", and the subset is smaller than it sounds:
//! everything past the dial and the mode is ELAD's own. Pointing the Kenwood
//! profile at an FDM-DUO gets the frequency right and then misses every meter,
//! the filter, the power and the split. The differences that matter:
//!
//! * **The S-meter is not a Kenwood S-meter.** `SM` answers on ELAD's own
//!   scale, where the counts are not evenly spaced — S5 is 6 and S6 is 8, with
//!   nothing at 7 — so no linear reading of it is right anywhere except by
//!   accident. The published points are in [`SMETER_CAL`].
//! * **SWR is `WR`, not `RM`.** It answers a real ratio in text (`01.50`)
//!   rather than a count of lit bars, and it carries its own "this reading is
//!   not to be trusted" flag, which is set in receive, below 500 mW, and after
//!   a high-SWR trip.
//! * **Power is nine fixed steps, not watts.** `TP` selects 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2,
//!   1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 or 5.0 W — a Kenwood-shaped `PC050;` is a syntax error,
//!   and even read as an index it would be five times the rig's whole output.
//! * **The receive filter is `RF`, indexed per mode.** Three different tables
//!   behind one command, and the mode digit selects which — see [`filter_index`].
//! * **Split is `SP`, and `FR0;` does not cancel it.** `SP0;` is the only thing
//!   that does.
//! * **The antenna is a *count*, not a port index.** `AN1;` is one antenna, on
//!   the RTX socket; `AN2;` is two — receive on the RX-only socket, transmit
//!   still out of RTX. It is read once at open (`AN;`) and otherwise left
//!   alone, because it is the operator's own front-panel setting (menu 31
//!   `ANTENNAS`) and it survives a power cycle.
//!
//! There is no DATA mode and no `DA` flag: `MD` has six positions and none of
//! them is a data position. Digital modes therefore go out as plain USB or LSB,
//! and which input the rig transmits from is the separate `TI` setting rather
//! than anything the mode says — which is why [`CatConfig::elad_tx_input`]
//! exists and is asserted when the port opens.
//!
//! **No text keyer.** `SW` triggers one of the ten CW messages stored *in the
//! radio*; there is no command that hands the rig arbitrary text, so
//! [`Protocol::cw_chunk_len`] stays 0 and CW is keyed by the operator's own key
//! or paddle (or by DTR, with menu 37 `CW IN` set to `Key+DTR`).
//!
//! Written from the *ELAD FDM-DUO User Manual* v2.6 (12/2017), §6 "CAT Remote
//! Control". **Not yet verified against a rig** — no ELAD hardware was
//! available. Everything below is transcribed from the command tables.
