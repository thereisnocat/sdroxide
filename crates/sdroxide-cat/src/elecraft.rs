//! Elecraft CAT (ASCII, `;`-terminated) — K3, K3S, KX3, KX2, and the K4 in so
//! far as it answers the K3 command set. Frequency `FA<11 digits>;`, mode
//! `MD<x>;`, PTT `TX;`/`RX;`, CW streamed to the rig's own keyer (`KY`).
//!
//! Descended from the same Kenwood dialect as [`crate::kenwood`] and near
//! enough to it that the Kenwood profile *almost* drives an Elecraft — which
//! is the dangerous kind of near. The differences that matter:
//!
//! * **DATA is a mode, not a flag.** `MD6` is DATA and `MD9` is DATA-REV; there
//!   is no `DA` command at all, and no `MD8`. A Kenwood-shaped `MD2;DA1;` puts
//!   an Elecraft in plain USB and then earns a `?;` for the `DA`, so every
//!   digital-mode over would go out on the wrong side of the filter with no
//!   sign that anything was refused.
//! * **`MD6` alone is not enough.** DATA carries a *sub-mode* — `DT0` DATA A,
//!   `DT1` AFSK A, `DT2` FSK D, `DT3` PSK D — and `MD6` restores whichever was
//!   last used on that band. Only DATA A is the sound-card path sdroxide
//!   drives; landing in FSK D or PSK D hands the over to the rig's own modem,
//!   which has nothing to send.
//! * **`TX1;` is not a command.** Elecraft keys with a bare `TX;`. (`TX0;` is
//!   not one either, so the Kenwood `RX;` unkey is the one thing that carries
//!   over unchanged.)
//! * **The power scale is not 100 W.** `PC` is watts, as on the other ASCII
//!   families, but a KX2 tops out at 12 and a KX3 at 15 while a K3 with its PA
//!   reaches 110. Rather than assume, the rig is asked what it is: see
//!   [`Elecraft::learn_options`].
//! * **`?;` is not a syntax error.** On this family it means the rig was busy
//!   or in a limited-access state (transmitting, BSET, VFO REV) — the same
//!   command may well be accepted a moment later. It is logged and nothing
//!   more; see the note above [`Protocol::parse`] for why it must not be read
//!   as a refusal the way CI-V's "NG" is.
//!
//! Two meta-commands are asserted when the port opens, because a rig left in
//! the other setting by whatever ran before us answers in a format this file
//! would misread:
//!
//! * `K20;` — K2 command modes 1 and 3 report DATA and DATA-REV *as LSB and
//!   USB*, so a rig in one of them looks like it never leaves SSB. Mode 2 adds
//!   a fourth digit to `PC`, which would read back as a power ten times too
//!   large.
//! * `K31;` — the extended S-meter scale (0..21 rather than 0..15). Both are
//!   handled, and a `K3;` readback settles which is in force.
//!
//! Written from Elecraft's public *K3S/K3/KX3/KX2 Programmer's Reference*
//! (Rev. G5, Feb. 20 2019). Not yet verified against a rig.
