//! flrig over XML-RPC — the other daemon, for a rig flrig already drives well.
//!
//! Like [`crate::rigctld`] this is not a radio but a program already driving
//! one, reached over a socket. The difference is what stands behind the
//! interface: flrig carries its own per-model driver for each transceiver, and
//! on a fair number of rigs its handling of the transmit power and the receive
//! bandwidth is the more faithful of the two daemons — which is precisely when
//! an operator reaches for this family. It also shares the rig: flrig's own
//! panel and every other program pointed at it stay live alongside this end.
//!
//! What is reached: the frequency, the mode (by the rig's own mode *names*,
//! learned from `rig.get_modes` at open), PTT both ways, the transmit power in
//! whole watts against the maximum the rig turns out to have (see
//! [`Flrig::max_w`] — flrig will not simply say), the receive bandwidth
//! (`rig.set_bandwidth` snaps to the nearest filter the driver has), the
//! S-meter — which flrig hands over already in dBm — and the SWR and power-out
//! faces while transmitting. CW goes through flrig's `cwio` keyer, a DTR/RTS
//! line on a serial port configured *inside flrig*, not the rig's internal
//! keyer: until that port is set up there, `rig.cwio_text` keys nothing. What
//! is not there at all: no RIT/XIT clear (flrig's interface has only split),
//! and no antenna switching.
//!
//! # The correlation problem
//!
//! An XML-RPC `methodResponse` carries a value and nothing else — nothing on
//! the wire names the request it answers, so a pipelined `rig.get_vfo` and
//! `rig.get_smeter` are indistinguishable coming back. Hamlib's extended
//! protocol solved this with an echo header; XML-RPC has none to offer. What
//! it does guarantee is *order*: one response per request, on one connection,
//! in the order the requests went in. So this file keeps a queue of the
//! methods actually written — fed by [`Protocol::wrote`], never at
//! frame-generation time, because a generated frame is not a written one (the
//! driver computes mode frames purely for comparison and dedups others away)
//! — and reads each complete HTTP response against the head of that queue.
//! [`Protocol::link_opened`] drops the queue with the connection it describes.
//!
//! # One question at a time
//!
//! Order is only worth correlating on if every request is answered, and
//! flrig's server does not manage that. It is XmlRpc++ 0.8, one `select` loop
//! on one thread shared by every client, and it reads its socket with
//! `nbRead`, which drains *everything* waiting there into one buffer. It finds
//! the first request in that buffer, answers it, and then clears the buffer
//! whole (`_header = ""; _request = "";` in `writeResponse`). A second request
//! that arrived while the first was being served is therefore discarded — no
//! response, no fault, no error, no close — and a client correlating by order
//! spends the rest of the session reading every answer against the wrong
//! question: the dial takes the S-meter's number, the transmit read takes a
//! frequency and reports an over nobody keyed.
//!
//! Nothing makes that likelier than transmitting: `rig.set_ptt` sits in
//! flrig's server thread for up to a second waiting for the radio to confirm
//! the change, and everything sent meanwhile piles up to be thrown away.
//!
//! So this profile reports what it has outstanding ([`Protocol::in_flight`])
//! and the driver holds the next frame until the answer is in. Hamlib's flrig
//! backend arrived at the same place from the other direction — it flushes its
//! socket before every command, with the comment "appears we can lose sync if
//! we don't clear things out".
//!
//! # The wire
//!
//! Requests are `POST` with `Content-Type: text/xml`, HTTP/1.1 and no
//! `Connection: close` — flrig's embedded XmlRpc server keeps a 1.1 connection
//! open unless told otherwise, so the one long-lived stream the driver holds
//! is exactly what it expects. Responses are framed by `Content-Length`, which
//! flrig always sends.
