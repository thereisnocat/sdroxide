//! Kenwood CAT (ASCII, `;`-terminated). Frequency `FA<11 digits>;`, mode
//! `MD<x>;`, PTT `TX…;`/`RX;`, CW streamed to the rig's own keyer (`KY`).
//!
//! Close enough to Yaesu's "new CAT" to look like the same protocol and far
//! enough away that pointing the Yaesu family at a Kenwood fails in every
//! direction at once — which is how this file came to exist. The differences
//! that matter:
//!
//! * **Frequency is eleven digits**, not the family-dependent eight or nine.
//!   A Yaesu-width `FA` is a syntax error the rig answers with `?;`, so the
//!   dial never moves.
//! * **`MD` has no VFO parameter.** Yaesu's read (`MD0;`) is a Kenwood *set*
//!   to mode 0, which is the documented "setting failure" value.
//! * **`TX0;` transmits.** Yaesu unkeys with it. A Kenwood told `TX0;` keys up
//!   and stays there, because the command that unkeys it is `RX;`.
//! * **`FT2;`** — Yaesu's "split off" — selects the memory channel as transmit
//!   VFO on a Kenwood, which the reference guide explicitly forbids.
//!
//! DATA mode is a flag beside the mode (`DA`) rather than a mode of its own, so
//! USB and USB-DATA are both `MD2;` and only `DA;` tells them apart.
//!
//! Written from Kenwood's public *PC Control Command Reference Guide* for the
//! TS-590S/TS-590SG (B5A-0316-20/01) and the TS-2000 command tables. Not yet
//! verified against a rig.
