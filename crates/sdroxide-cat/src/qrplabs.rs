//! QRP Labs CAT (ASCII, `;`-terminated) — QMX, QMX+ and the QDX-series
//! ancestors that share the command set. Frequency `FA<11 digits>;`, mode
//! `MD<x>;`, PTT `TX;`/`RX;`, CW streamed to the rig's own keyer (`KY`).
//!
//! A third Kenwood dialect, and the one that says so out loud: "QMX implements
//! a subset of the Kenwood TS-480/TS-440 CAT command set". The subset is small
//! and the additions are large, which is why it is a family rather than a
//! Kenwood with a note attached:
//!
//! * **A carriage return is not whitespace — it is a mode switch.** "QMX
//!   interprets an incoming carriage return character as a trigger to switch
//!   the serial port to terminal mode." One stray CR and the port stops being a
//!   CAT port for the rest of the session. Nothing here ever writes one, and
//!   nothing here ever should.
//! * **`PC` reads, it does not set.** On every other ASCII family `PC` is the
//!   transmit power control, in watts. Here it is the *power meter*, in tenths
//!   of a watt, and there is no CAT command that sets the power at all — so
//!   this family reports what the radio measured (`fwd_w`, real watts) and
//!   commands nothing. A Kenwood-shaped `PC005;` would be a meter read with
//!   junk on the end.
//! * **`MD8` is not a mode.** It is SWR Tune: the radio holds a carrier into
//!   its own bridge. It is never commanded from here, and a rig reporting it is
//!   reported as no mode rather than as some sideband it is not on.
//! * **The sound card is two different things.** `Q9` switches the USB codec
//!   between demodulated audio and the raw I/Q the ADC sees, so which one the
//!   operator picked in Settings has to be asserted *at the radio* — a rig left
//!   in I/Q mode by a previous session feeds quadrature into the audio path,
//!   which is noise, and one left out of it feeds audio into the panadapter,
//!   which is a spectrum of the demodulator.
//! * **`SS` decides whose voice goes out.** SSB transmit audio comes from the
//!   host's sound card, an internal two-tone generator, or the microphone. This
//!   interface only works on the first, so it asserts it — the ELAD `TI` trap
//!   in another dialect.
//!
//! Deliberately not used: `TA`, which transmits a *tone frequency* commanded
//! over CAT rather than audio through the sound card. It is the neatest digital
//! transmit path any radio here offers and it is the wrong shape for this
//! program, whose modems synthesise audio; the sound card is the interface both
//! ends already agree on.
//!
//! Written from QRP Labs' *QMX CAT programming manual* (firmware 1.04_004,
//! 23-Jul-2026) and the *QMX operating manual* (1_00_022) for the receiver's
//! architecture and its meter scales. **Not verified against a radio.**
