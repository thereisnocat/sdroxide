//! Hamlib `rigctld` over TCP — the catch-all, for a radio no native profile
//! covers.
//!
//! Every other profile in this crate speaks a manufacturer's own dialect and
//! knows things about it that a translation layer cannot: which Kenwood this is
//! and therefore what its meters read on, that an Elecraft's DATA mode needs a
//! sub-mode pinned behind it, how much text a rig's keyer buffer takes at a
//! time. Between them they still cover five makes. Hamlib covers a couple of
//! hundred, and where it is already installed and working there is no reason to
//! be locked out of it.
//!
//! What is given up is worth stating plainly. This profile reaches the
//! frequency, the mode, PTT, the transmit power, the S-meter and the SWR, and
//! nothing else — no keying from the rig's own text buffer, no filter tables,
//! no per-model anything. Where a native profile fits the radio, it is the
//! better answer.
//!
//! # The extended protocol
//!
//! Commands go out with a leading `+`, which is what makes the answers
//! *self-describing*. In the default protocol a `f` is answered with a bare
//! `14074000` and a `t` with a bare `1`, and nothing on the wire says which
//! reply is which — fine for a client that sends one command and blocks for its
//! answer, useless for one that pipelines a poll and reads whatever comes back.
//! With `+` the daemon answers in blocks:
//!
//! ```text
//! get_freq:
//! Frequency: 14074000
//! RPRT 0
//! ```
//!
//! The first line names the command, the middle lines carry labelled values and
//! `RPRT` closes the block with Hamlib's error code. That echo header is what
//! this file keys on rather than the value labels, because the labels are the
//! one part that has moved between Hamlib versions — and because `get_level`
//! answers three different meters under the same label, with only the header
//! saying which was asked for.
//!
//! Newlines terminate commands here, not semicolons: a `\n` is the frame
//! boundary, and [`crate::write_frame`]'s inter-frame gap is as harmless over a
//! socket as it is over a wire.
