//! Yaesu "new CAT" (ASCII, `;`-terminated). Frequency `FA<n digits>;`, mode
//! `MD0<x>;`, PTT `TX1;`/`TX0;`, CW from the rig's own keyer (`KM`/`KY`).
//!
//! The one thing that is not the same across the family is how wide the
//! frequency field is: eight digits on the FT-450/950/2000 and FTDX1200/3000/
//! 5000 generation, nine on the FT-891/991/991A, FTDX10/101 and FT-710. A set
//! written at the wrong width is not rounded or clamped — the rig rejects the
//! whole command with `?;` and stays where it was, so a mismatch presents as a
//! radio that answers every poll and ignores every retune. Rather than ask the
//! operator which generation they own, [`Yaesu`] reads the width off the rig:
//! the answer to `FA;` carries the model's native digit count, so the first
//! poll reply settles it (this is what Hamlib derives from the `IF;` reply
//! length). Until one arrives the newer nine is assumed, and a set written
//! before the rig corrected us is re-issued — see [`Protocol::reframed`].
