//! `AprsController` — the Automatic Packet Reporting System.
//!
//! The modem, the framing and CSMA are [`crate::ax25_channel::Ax25Channel`]'s,
//! shared with [`crate::PacketController`]: on the air an APRS frame is an
//! ordinary 1200 baud AX.25 UI frame and nothing about the link layer differs.
//! What is here is everything above it — the codec in `sdroxide-aprs`, the
//! stations it builds into a map, the message layer with its retries, and the
//! beacon.
//!
//! # What makes APRS different from packet
//!
//! **It is one channel, not a band.** Every station in radio range of every
//! other shares it, and the region decides which frequency (see
//! `sdroxide_types::aprs_dial`). That is why the transmit side is as
//! conservative as it is: the beacon is off until the operator turns it on,
//! the message retries back off, and the digipeater path is a setting with a
//! warning attached.
//!
//! **Everything is broadcast.** There is no connection, no sequence number and
//! no acknowledgement — except for messages, which bolt one on top by carrying
//! an identifier that the addressee echoes back. So a message is the only
//! thing here with a timer, and everything else is fire-and-forget.
//!
//! **Frames arrive several times.** A digipeater repeats what it hears, and on
//! a busy channel two or three of them repeat the same frame. Every incoming
//! path therefore has to be idempotent: a position simply overwrites, and a
//! message is de-duplicated by (sender, identifier) — but *re-acknowledged*,
//! because a repeat usually means the sender did not hear the first ack.
