//! `CwController` — the receive decoder and keyer behind the CW panel.
//!
//! CW is not a digital mode and this is not a digital-mode controller in the
//! sense the others are: there is no modem, no framing and nothing that has to
//! be decoded before the operator can use the signal. The rig is in CW, the
//! demodulated tone is what an operator listens to, and everything here runs
//! *alongside* that rather than in place of it — the panel reads a copy of what
//! the ear is already hearing, and keys what the operator types.
//!
//! It implements [`DigiEngine`] all the same, because the seam is exactly the
//! right shape: an audio tap in, actions and transmit audio out. What it does
//! not take from the other modes is ownership of the audio path. The
//! demodulated CW stays audible throughout.
//!
//! Two things are one thing here, and that is deliberate. The decoder listens
//! at `cw_pitch_hz` above the dial and the keyer transmits there, because in CW
//! those are the same frequency: you answer a station on the frequency you
//! heard it on, and the waterfall cursor that picks one picks the other.
//!
//! The text comes from DeepCW, which reads the spectrogram with a neural net
//! and copies several dB further down than a timing fit reaches. It answers only
//! that one question, though — it has no notion of speed, signal-to-noise, or
//! where the tone actually is. So the classic [`CwRx`] front end stays, running
//! alongside for exactly those readouts, and its AFC is also what tells the
//! tuner where to find the signal.
//!
//! Sending has two routes, and which one is right is a property of the radio
//! rather than of the operator. On an SDR the keyer's sidetone *is* the signal:
//! it goes through the transmit chain like any other audio and comes out as
//! on-off keying. On a transceiver told to be in CW it is nothing at all — the
//! rig keys its own transmitter and never modulates what arrives at its sound
//! card — so there the text is handed to the rig's keyer instead and the rig
//! does the sending. [`CatKeyer`] is that second route.
