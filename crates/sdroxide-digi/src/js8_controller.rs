//! The JS8 engine seam: slot timing, decode dispatch, and the transmit queue.
//!
//! Structurally this is [`crate::DigiController`] with two things taken away
//! and one added.
//!
//! **No even/odd discipline.** FT8 stations alternate, and the FT8 controller
//! spends real effort staying opposite the station it is working. JS8 stations
//! transmit when they have something to say, so there is no period to be on the
//! wrong side of.
//!
//! **No QSO machine.** FT8's `QsoMachine` sequences a contest exchange through
//! Tx1–Tx6. JS8 carries a conversation: what to send next is whatever the
//! operator typed, and the only automatic traffic is a reply to a direct
//! question.
//!
//! **A frame queue instead.** A message longer than one frame occupies
//! consecutive slots, so transmit is a `VecDeque<Js8Payload>` drained one frame
//! per slot. Auto-replies join the back of that queue rather than jumping it,
//! which is what stops the station keying twice in a slot or interrupting the
//! operator mid-message.
