//! `PacketController` — AX.25 packet radio, on HF and on VHF/UHF.
//!
//! Modem, deframer, codec, the monitor an operator watches, CSMA, and the
//! connected-mode link with the terminal that drives it.
//!
//! # One link, two possible owners
//!
//! There is one radio and one channel, so there is one connected-mode link —
//! and two things that want it: the operator, typing at a node or a BBS from
//! the packet panel, and a Winlink forwarding session driven from the MAIL
//! window. They exclude each other through the lease on
//! [`sdroxide_ax25::PortEndpoint`], which either end may take and the other is
//! then refused, so the second one to ask gets a clear answer rather than the
//! two interleaving on one link and producing traffic neither understands.
//!
//! The lease also decides whether this station **answers** calls: while a
//! session holds the link an incoming connect has nowhere to go, so it is
//! refused with a DM rather than accepted into a link somebody else is using.
//!
//! # Why one controller for two modes
//!
//! [`Mode::Packet`] (VHF/UHF, FM) and [`Mode::PacketHf`] (HF, sideband) are the
//! same link layer over different radios. The waveform differs — Bell 202 tones
//! at 1200, a shaped scrambled baseband at 9600, 200 Hz-shift AFSK at 300 — but
//! above the bit stream every one of them is HDLC and AX.25, so the split lives
//! in the modem this holds, not in the controller or the protocol.
//!
//! The `Mode` split exists because the *radio* differs: FM against sideband
//! decides the filter, the modulator, the mode commanded over CAT and where the
//! band plan puts it. Those are per-`Mode` constants throughout the tree, and
//! one variant with a config field would have to thread that field into every
//! one of them.
//!
//! The modem, the framing and the two rules that make a packet station behave
//! on a shared channel live in [`crate::ax25_channel`], which
//! [`crate::AprsController`] runs as well.
