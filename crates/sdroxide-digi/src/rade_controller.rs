//! `RadeController` — FreeDV **RADE V1** digital voice.
//!
//! Structurally this is the keyboard-modem controller with speech in place of
//! text: transmit is a continuous over the operator opens and closes rather
//! than a timed burst, and receive runs incrementally as audio arrives.
//!
//! Two things make it unlike every other mode here, and they are why
//! [`DigiEngine`] grew `rx_audio_out`, `wants_mic` and `on_tx_mic`:
//!
//! * it *produces* receive audio (synthesized speech) instead of text or an
//!   image, so the engine plays its output in place of the demodulated signal;
//! * it transmits the live microphone rather than a burst it synthesised
//!   itself.
//!
//! All the signal processing — acquisition, demodulation, neural decode,
//! vocoding and every sample-rate conversion — happens on
//! [`RadeWorker`]'s own thread. This controller only moves samples across ring
//! buffers, so nothing here can stall the engine's audio loop.
