//! The WSPR scan loop, rebuilt to keep the SNR and the drift.
//!
//! `mfsk_core::wspr::decode::decode_scan` does the right search and then throws
//! away two of its results. Its coarse stage produces a `BasebandCandidate`
//! carrying `snr_db` (wsprd-calibrated, referenced to the 2500 Hz bandwidth
//! WSPR reports in) and `drift_hz`; its `WsprResult` has neither field, so by
//! the time a decode comes back the numbers are gone. A WSPR spot without an
//! SNR is not a spot — it is the measurement the entire network exists to
//! pool — so the loop is reproduced here over the same crate's public
//! primitives, threading the originating candidate through to the result.
//!
//! It began as a faithful copy of upstream's structure and has since diverged
//! where measurement said it had to. What it does that upstream's does not, all
//! of it measured against `wsprd` on identical audio (see
//! `examples/wspr_bench.rs`):
//!
//! * **Refuses decodes the audio does not support.** The code carries no CRC
//!   and the OSD fallback answers with a valid codeword for any input, so
//!   pointed at noise it invents a callsign rather than failing. [`fit_of`] and
//!   [`is_plausible`] are what stop that, and on a synthesised band they took
//!   the invented stations from twenty-two to none.
//! * **Normalises the bit metrics** before the Fano decoder sees them, which
//!   `mfsk-core` says it needs and defers — see [`normalise`].
//! * **Retries the decode across a grid** rather than trusting the alignment
//!   with the best sync score, which at these SNRs is not reliable — see
//!   [`FREQ_RETRY_STEP_HZ`].
//! * **Computes the true sequential-decoding branch metric** instead of the
//!   linear approximation `mfsk-core` hands Fano — see [`branch_metric`].
//! * **Subtracts from the decoder's own recovered bits** rather than re-packing
//!   the message, so compound and hashed-callsign signals are cancelled too.
//!
//! The three-second front pad and the successive-interference-cancellation
//! shape are upstream's.
