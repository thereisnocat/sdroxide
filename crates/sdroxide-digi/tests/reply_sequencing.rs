//! A reply goes out in the slot *opposite* the station being answered.
//!
//! Driven through the real controller with real audio: a DX calls CQ into the
//! receiver, the operator presses REPLY once the decode is in, and the test
//! watches which slots the burst actually keys in. Nothing here reads the
//! controller's internals — the question the operator asks is "did I transmit
//! on top of them", and that is what this measures.
