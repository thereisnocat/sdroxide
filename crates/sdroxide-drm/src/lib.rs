//! Digital Radio Mondiale reception, over the **Dream** receiver.
//!
//! DRM is a shortwave broadcast system: OFDM, a few hundred carriers in 9 or
//! 10 kHz, carrying an AAC-coded programme plus a service label, a scrolling
//! text message and the broadcaster's clock. Decoding it end to end means
//! acquisition, channel estimation, MLC/QAM demapping, Viterbi decoding, the
//! FAC/SDC/MSC multiplex and finally the audio codec — which is why this wraps
//! Dream (<https://sourceforge.net/projects/drm/>) rather than reimplementing
//! any of it. The sources are vendored at `vendor/dream`; `vendor/PROVENANCE.md`
//! there lists the three changes made to them.
//!
//! The shape follows [`sdroxide_rade`]: a C++ shim reduces the upstream library
//! to a handful of C calls, `build.rs` compiles and binds it, and a worker
//! thread drives it so no decode ever runs on the audio path.
//!
//! Three layers live here:
//!
//! * [`Ring`] — the sample queues either side of the decoder, and the only
//!   thing that crosses threads.
//! * [`Decoder`] — one Dream receiver. Every method must be called on the
//!   thread that built it.
//! * [`DrmWorker`] — the two above driven on a dedicated thread, which is how
//!   [`DrmDemod`] uses them.
//!
//! Where openwebrx pipes 48 kHz zero-IF I/Q into a `dream` subprocess, this
//! feeds the same samples to the same code in-process — see [`DrmDemod`] for
//! the one thing that costs, which is the intermediate frequency Dream insists
//! on.
