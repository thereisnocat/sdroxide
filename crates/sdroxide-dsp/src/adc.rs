//! Converter headroom: how close the front end is running to its rails.
//!
//! Everything downstream of the discriminator is indifferent to signal level —
//! an FM demodulator is `arg()`, and the RDS receiver's carrier and timing
//! errors are both magnitude-normalised — so no amount of signal can overload
//! the software. The converter is another matter, and when it clips, what the
//! operator loses first is the thing they are least likely to notice.
//!
//! Measured on a broadcast station driven progressively harder into a ±1.0
//! converter (1.92 Msps, the station 480 kHz off the LO):
//!
//! | drive | at full scale | audio noise | RDS |
//! |------:|--------------:|------------:|:----|
//! | ≤1.0× | 0 % | −104 dB | clean |
//! | 1.4× | 99 % | −51 dB | clean |
//! | 1.6× | 100 % | −47 dB | 7 % of blocks bad |
//! | 1.8× | 100 % | −45 dB | sync lost |
//! | 2.0× | 100 % | −43 dB | no station name |
//!
//! Two things make this worth a meter of its own. The cliff is **about one dB
//! wide** — 1.6× to 1.8× — so a fade or a passing car walks a station across it
//! and RDS flickers on and off. And the audio never tells: the pilot stayed
//! locked and the stereo blend full at every drive in that table, with in-band
//! noise still 45 dB down where the data was already dead. FM's noise is
//! triangular, rising 6 dB per octave, so at 57 kHz it is some 15 dB worse than
//! where the programme lives, and the subcarrier sitting 28–34 dB below peak
//! deviation in 2.4 kHz of bandwidth is always the first casualty. The station
//! sounds perfect while its data is gone, which is exactly the report that
//! reaches the issue tracker as "RDS fails on strong signals".
//!
//! So the reading is published whether or not anything is decoding: it is the
//! one number that says the answer is *turn the gain down*.
