//! AFSK for AX.25 packet: two tones, a bit stream, and nothing above it.
//!
//! Serves both audio-frequency packet speeds, which differ only in constants:
//!
//! | | mark | space | baud | where |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | HF | 1600 Hz | 1800 Hz | 300 | single sideband |
//! | VHF | 1200 Hz | 2200 Hz | 1200 | audio into an FM transmitter (Bell 202) |
//!
//! Those are Direwolf's defaults for `-B 300` and `-B 1200`, which is what
//! makes them the right ones: the deployed gateway population is what a modem
//! has to agree with.
//!
//! # Relationship to the RTTY modem
//!
//! The detector is [`crate::rtty::RttyRx`]'s, and deliberately so — it is the
//! same problem (non-coherent binary FSK on HF) already solved here against a
//! real signal. Mix to the centre tone, band-limit, rotate each tone to DC and
//! integrate over exactly one bit, then slice on the difference of the two
//! envelopes, each referred to its own recent level so a selective fade decides
//! nothing. That last part, automatic threshold correction, matters more at 300
//! baud on HF than anywhere else in this tree.
//!
//! What is **not** shared is everything above the bit:
//!
//! * RTTY re-acquires its bit clock on every start bit, because a UART gives it
//!   one 7.5 bits. HDLC is a continuous stream with no framing bits at all, so
//!   the clock here free-runs and is nudged by transitions. It can afford to:
//!   NRZI puts a transition on every zero bit, and HDLC's bit stuffing
//!   guarantees a zero at least every five bits. Clock recovery is *why*
//!   stuffing has that limit, not merely a consequence of it.
//! * There is no framing validation and no lock gate. RTTY needs one because a
//!   UART will manufacture a character out of noise; HDLC has a flag and a
//!   16-bit FCS to do that job properly, one layer up.
//!
//! So this emits raw line levels and judges nothing. `sdroxide-ax25`'s deframer
//! decides what was a frame.
