///
/// * Every second tap is zero (that is what a half-band *is*), so half the

///   one multiply: `x[a]·t + x[b]·t` is `(x[a] + x[b])·t`. That is a complex
///   add standing in for a complex multiply — seven multiplies where the
///   straightforward loop does thirteen.
/// * The surviving taps are all at *even* offsets, save the lone centre one at
///   an odd offset. So the filter never mixes the two phases of its input:
///   split `x` into `even[m] = x[2m]` and `odd[m] = x[2m+1]` and one output is

/// That last point is the whole reason for the split, and it is worth being
/// plain about what it buys. The direct form indexes its window with a stride
/// of two, and a stride the compiler cannot flatten means one output at a time
/// however wide the registers are: measured against `-C target-cpu=native`, the
