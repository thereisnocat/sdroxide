//! NAVTEX: SITOR-B (ITU-R M.625 collective B-mode) at 100 baud, 170 Hz shift.
//!
//! The maritime safety broadcast every coast station in the world sends on
//! 518 kHz in English, on 490 kHz in the national language and on 4209.5 kHz in
//! the tropics. Navigational and meteorological warnings, search-and-rescue
//! bulletins, ice reports and pilot notices — one of the few utility services
//! still worth leaving a receiver on (issue #212).
//!
//! # What the mode is
//!
//! Frequency-shift keying, 170 Hz apart, 100 bits a second, in a **7-bit
//! constant-ratio alphabet**: every valid character has exactly four mark bits
//! and three space bits, so any single bit error makes a code that cannot
//! exist. That is the whole of the error *detection*, and the correction is
//! time diversity — **every character is sent twice, five character times
//! apart**, so the stream alternates between a leading copy and the repeat of a
//! character sent five slots earlier:
//!
//! ```text
//! N  ·  A  ·  U  N  T  A  I  U  C  T  A  I  L  C  _  A  _  L
//! ```
//!
//! ("NAUTICAL", with the odd slots five behind the even ones.) A character
//! whose leading copy is corrupt is taken from its repeat, and only when both
//! are bad is anything lost.
//!
//! # Why the front end is written out again
//!
//! It is the same shape as [`crate::rtty::RttyRx`]'s — mix, band-limit,
//! integrate two tones over a bit, decide against each tone's own recent level
//! — and it is deliberately not shared with it. RTTY's framing is asynchronous
//! start/stop and this is a continuous synchronous stream with no framing bits
//! at all, so only the front half would be common; and RTTY is a mode that
//! works, on the air, today. Refactoring underneath it to save eighty lines
//! here is a trade nobody asked for.
