//! RDS/RBDS: the data subcarrier on a broadcast FM multiplex.
//!
//! The composite coming out of the WFM discriminator carries, above the stereo
//! difference channel, a suppressed-carrier 57 kHz subcarrier with 1187.5 bps of
//! data on it. 57 kHz is exactly three times the 19 kHz stereo pilot, and the
//! standard requires the two to be locked — which is worth something here, since
//! the pilot is an un-suppressed tone at 10 % injection while the data
//! subcarrier is suppressed at 2–4 %.
//!
//! ```text
//! mpx ──► DDC (mix 57 kHz → DC, decimate to ~15 kHz)
//!      ──► biphase matched filter, Costas carrier, Gardner timing
//!      ──► differential detection ──► bits
//!      ──► 26-bit blocks, (26,16) syndrome + offset words ──► groups
//!      ──► group parsing ──► RdsData
//! ```
//!
//! **Carrier recovery is independent of the pilot**, and only *aided* by it. The
//! pilot's tracked frequency, tripled, retunes the down-converter — which takes
//! the station's and our own clock error out of the Costas loop's job and lets it
//! stay narrow. Its phase is deliberately not used: stations transmit RDS without
//! a stereo pilot, and the standard permits the subcarrier to sit in phase *or in
//! quadrature* with the pilot's third harmonic, so a phase-derived reference
//! needs an ambiguity resolver and a second code path for the unaided case. One
//! path that always works beats two that each work sometimes.
//!
//! **The line code does half the work for free.** RDS differentially encodes
//! before biphase-shaping, so differential detection — the same `d = curr ·
//! conj(prev)` the PSK31 receiver uses — recovers the data bits directly and the
//! Costas loop's 180° ambiguity never has to be resolved.
//!
//! Everything downstream is bit-exact and self-checking: a block whose syndrome
//! does not match one of the five offset words is not a block, so a decoder
//! parked on noise stays silent rather than inventing a station.
