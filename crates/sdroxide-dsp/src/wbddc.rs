//! Wideband digital downconverter: real samples in, complex baseband out.
//!
//! Built for a direct-sampling front end like the RX-888, which hands over
//! 16-bit *real* samples at the full ADC rate — 64.8 Msps covering 0–32.4 MHz —
//! and has no downconverter of its own. Everything downstream in sdroxide
//! expects complex baseband at a rate a normal DSP chain can carry, so the
//! conversion has to happen here, and it has to be cheap enough to run at
//! 64.8 million samples a second.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! A weighted overlap-add (WOLA) analysis filter bank:
//!
//! 1. Take `N` real input samples, advancing `N/2` each block, and apply a Hann
//!    window. Hann at 50 % overlap sums to a constant, which is what makes the
//!    blocks reassemble into a continuous signal.
//! 2. Real FFT of size `N`, giving `N/2 + 1` bins spaced `fs/N` apart.
//! 3. Copy the `M` bins covering the wanted band into a complex buffer. Doing
//!    this — and *only* this — is both the band-pass filter and the
//!    real-to-complex conversion, because the negative-frequency half of the
//!    spectrum is simply never copied. The band edges are tapered so the filter
//!    is not a brick wall, whose impulse response would ring for the length of
//!    the block.
//! 4. Inverse complex FFT of size `M`, and overlap-add the result with hop
//!    `M/2`.
//!
//! The output rate is `fs · M / N`: with `fs = 64.8 MHz`, `N = 8192` and
//! `M = 256` that is 2.025 Msps, which the engine's ordinary [`crate::ddc::Ddc`]
//! then takes down to audio.
//!
//! # Tuning
//!
//! Coarse tuning is the choice of `M` bins, in steps of `fs/N` (7.9 kHz at the
//! default settings). The remainder is a complex mixer on the *output*, running
//! at the low rate where it costs nothing. See [`WbDdc::set_center_hz`].
