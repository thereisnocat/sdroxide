//! The device state machine: the open sequence, tuning, and the front end.
//!
//! # The open sequence is load-bearing
//!
//! On the FDM-DUO the FIFO must be stopped, then initialised, then *configured*,
//! then started — and the frequency and front-end settings have to go out in
//! the window between the initialise and the start. ELAD's own module does it
//! in that order and nothing says what happens if it is not; a driver written
//! against a device nobody has is not the place to find out. [`Device::open`]
//! is therefore one function rather than a set of setters the caller sequences.
//!
//! The samplers differ in one place and it is the last step: their FIFO is
//! started by [`Device::start_pending`] from the stream thread, once the bulk
//! transfers are already queued. That is the order of the only driver anybody
//! has streamed an FDM-S2 with, and the reverse of `gr-elad`'s. See issue #178.
