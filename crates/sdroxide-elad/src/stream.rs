//! The one blocking thread that owns the device.

//! Queued bulk transfers on endpoint `0x86` via nusb's
//! [`nusb::Endpoint::wait_next_complete`], which blocks with a timeout — so this
//! is a plain `std::thread` with no executor, matching every other backend in
//! the workspace. Control arrives over a crossbeam channel and is coalesced
//! (see [`Pending`]) so a panadapter drag cannot starve the sample stream.
//!
//! # Why the control path matters more here
//!
//! On an FDM-DUO a retune is a control transfer *plus* a CAT write, and the CAT
//! write polls a busy flag in front of it — up to two seconds in the worst case.
//! That is far longer than the transfer queue holds at the higher rates, so the
//! queue is topped up before any control work and again immediately after it.
