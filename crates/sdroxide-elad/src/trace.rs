//! A self-contained session trace, so a user with an ELAD can produce a report
//! that a developer without one can read.
//!
//! This backend was written from ELAD's own GNU Radio module and their CAT
//! manual rather than on a bench, which makes the trace load-bearing rather
//! than a nicety. Everything here also goes to `tracing`, but `tracing` is the
//! wrong shape for a bug report: it needs `RUST_LOG` set before the run, and
//! asking somebody to reproduce an open failure with the right filter set is
//! asking them to reproduce it twice. A [`Trace`] is always on, bounded, and
//! dumps as one text block.
//!
//! # What it records
//!
//! Every vendor request with its `wValue`, `wIndex`, the length asked for, the
//! length that came back and either the decode or the exact transfer error; the
//! whole EEPROM calibration; the tuning arithmetic for the current dial
//! including the three fields actually sent; and the head of the first bulk
//! completion both as hex and as decoded `(re, im)` pairs.
//!
//! The two questions this driver cannot answer for itself are both settled from
//! that last line and from [`Trace::measured_rate`]: whether the samples really
//! are `I` before `Q`, and what rate the DDC was actually running at.
