//! The handle the rest of the program holds.

//! Same shape as [`sdroxide_spyserver::SpyServerHandle`], and for the same
//! reason: two output lanes with very different needs. The I/Q rides an `rtrb`
//! ring, because every sample matters and the reader is a DSP chain. The
//! waterfall rides a mutex-guarded slot where the newest frame overwrites an
//! unread one, because a six-frame-old picture of the band is worth nothing
//! beside a current one.
//!
//! What is different here is that the two lanes are two *sockets*, on two
//! threads. The receiver treats them as one session — they share a timestamp in
//! their URLs — but nothing else couples them, and the waterfall may fail to
//! open without costing the operator their receiver.
