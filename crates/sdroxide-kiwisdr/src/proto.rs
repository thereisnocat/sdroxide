//! the protocol is documented nowhere. What is here was read off a live
//! KiwiSDR 1 running v1.902 and then checked against the two packet structs in
//! the server's own `rx/rx_sound.h` and `rx/rx_waterfall.h`.
//!
//! # The one asymmetry worth knowing about
//!
//! The audio packet's tag is **three** bytes (`char id[3]` — `strncpy(…, "SND",
//! 3)`), and the waterfall packet's is **four** (`char id4[4]`, holding
//! `"W/F "`). Reading three in both places leaves every waterfall field a byte
//! out: `x_bin_server` comes back as 32 — the space — and a stray byte appears
//! in front of the bins. It looks like a plausible frame, which is what makes
//! it worth a paragraph.
