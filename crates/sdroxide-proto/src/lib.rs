/// Bump on any incompatible change to the message enums (this includes the

/// v3: `QsoRecord` gained `id` + `comment` fields.
/// v4: added `ServerMsg::SkimmerSpots` + `Command::SetSkimmerEnabled` + a
/// `RadioState.skimmer_enabled` field.
/// v5: added SSTV — `Mode::Sstv`, `ServerMsg::Sstv*`, and
/// `Command::SstvTx`/`SstvSetMode`.
/// v6: added audio noise reduction + auto-notch — `Command::SetNoiseReduction`,
/// `Command::SetAutoNotch`, and `RxState.noise_reduction` / `RxState.auto_notch`.
/// v7: added keyboard modes Olivia/Thor/FSQ — new `Mode` variants, `DigiConfig`
/// submode fields (Olivia tones/bw, THOR submode, FSQ speed/call), `DigiStatus`
/// FSQ heard-list + directed-message fields, and a mode-agnostic digi image path
/// (`Command::DigiImageTx` / `RadioEvent::DigiImage` for the FSQ image sub-mode).
/// v8: added the audio recorder — `Command::SetRecording` and
/// `RadioState.recording` / `RadioState.recording_file`.
/// v9: FT8/FT4 QSO handling — `QsoStep::WaitCq` / `Confirming` and
/// `Command::DigiStartQso.wait_for_cq`.
/// v10: neural (RNNoise) noise reduction — new `NrLevel::Ai{Low,Med,High}`
/// variants can appear in `RxState.noise_reduction`.
/// v11: network cockpit — spot feeds, callsign lookup, and uploads. New
/// `Command::SetNetworkConfig`/`SpotDialHint`/`LookupCallsign`/`UploadQso`/
/// `SyncConfirmations` and `ServerMsg::Spots`/`NetStatus`/`CallsignResult`/
/// `Upload`/`Confirmations`, plus new `QsoRecord` fields.
/// v12: per-kind skimmer control — `RadioState.skimmer_enabled` became
/// `RadioState.skimmer: SkimmerSettings` (CW/PSK/RTTY enables + squelch) and
/// `Command::SetSkimmerEnabled` became `Command::SetSkimmerConfig`.
/// v13: built-in TCI server — `Command::SetTciServerConfig` and
/// `ServerMsg::TciServerStatus`.
/// v14: FreeDV Reporter — new `SpotKind::FreeDv` (extends the postcard
/// discriminant space of `ServerMsg::Spots`) and `NetworkConfig`'s new
/// `freedv_reporter` field. `NetworkConfig` also lost `my_call`/`my_grid`: the
/// operator identity is `DigiConfig`'s alone, so both ends must agree on the
/// shape `Command::SetNetworkConfig` carries.
/// v15: built-in Hamlib rigctld server — `Command::SetRigctldConfig` and
/// `ServerMsg::RigctldStatus` (both extend the postcard discriminant space).
/// v16: FT8 message handling and reporting. `Decode` gained `cq_dx` and
/// `free_text`, `TranscriptLine` gained `overheard`, and `PskConfig` gained the
/// upload fields — postcard is not self-describing, so every added field
/// changes the layout of the messages carrying them. Also new:
/// `Command::SetWsjtxConfig` (WSJT-X UDP broadcast).
/// v17: manual FT8 message control — `Command::DigiSetStep` and
/// `Command::DigiSendText` (both extend the postcard discriminant space).
/// v18: FT8 transmit watchdog — `DigiStatus.tx_watchdog` plus `DigiConfig`'s
/// `tx_watchdog_min` / `max_tx_repeats`, which both ends must agree on.
/// v19: voice keyer — `Command::VoiceRecord`/`VoicePlay`/`VoicePreview`/
/// `VoiceClear`/`VoiceRename` and `ServerMsg::VoiceStatus` (both extend the
/// postcard discriminant space).
/// v20: Hellschreiber — `ServerMsg::HellColumns` plus `DigiConfig`'s
/// `hell_variant` / `hell_rx_agc`, which both ends must agree on because
/// `DigiStatus` carries the config. (`Mode::Hell` alone would have been
/// compatible: it is appended to the enum, so no existing discriminant moves.)
/// v21: FT8 DXpedition mode — `DigiConfig`'s `dxped_mode` / `fox_slots`,
/// `DigiStatus.fox_queue`, and `Decode.rr73_to` (the RR73 half of a Fox
/// message, which is how a Hound learns its contact completed). Postcard is not
/// self-describing, so both ends must agree on every one of those fields.
/// v22: clock-offset monitoring — `DigiStatus.clock_offset_s`.
/// v23: directed CQs — `Decode.cq_dx` became `Decode.cq_to`, the modifier
/// itself (`DX`, `EU`, `JA`, `POTA`, …) rather than a single DX flag.
/// v24: the FT8/FT4 call queue — `Command::DigiQueueAdd`/`DigiQueueRemove` and
/// `DigiStatus.call_queue`.
/// v25: automatic transmit-frequency choice — `DigiConfig.auto_tx_freq`.
/// v26: RIFP (draft-dulaunoy-rifp-00) — `Mode::Rifp` and `Band::M70` (both
/// appended, so no existing discriminant moves), `Command::RifpTx` /
/// `RifpDropSession`, `ServerMsg::RifpRows` / `RifpImage` / `RifpStatus`, and
/// `DigiConfig`'s `rifp_*` fields, which both ends must agree on because
/// `DigiStatus` carries the config.
/// v27: WFM broadcast stereo — `RxState.wfm_stereo`, `Meters.stereo` and
/// `Command::SetWfmStereo`. The command is appended so no existing discriminant
/// moves, but postcard is not self-describing, so the two added struct fields
/// change the layout of every message carrying `RadioState` or `Meters`.
/// v28: JS8 — `Mode::Js8`, the `js8_*` fields on `DigiConfig`, and
/// `DigiStatus.js8` carrying the heard list, the reassembled conversation and
/// transmit-queue progress. No message enum gained a variant, but postcard is
/// not self-describing and the added struct fields change the layout of every
/// message carrying `DigiConfig` or `DigiStatus`.
/// v29: JS8 beaconing — `DigiConfig`'s `js8_hb_ack` (answer a heard heartbeat
/// with a signal report) and `js8_hb_anywhere` (beacon on the working frequency
/// instead of the 500–1000 Hz sub-band), plus `Js8Status.hb_hz`, the frequency
/// the last beacon actually went out on. `Js8Status.next_hb_in_s` is now
/// populated rather than always `None`, which is a behaviour change but not a
/// layout one. Both ends must agree on the three added fields, postcard being
/// what it is.
/// v30: broadcast station labels — new `SpotKind::Broadcast`, which extends the
/// postcard discriminant space of `ServerMsg::Spots` exactly as `FreeDv` did in
/// v14. The engine never emits it (the stations are synthesised client-side from
/// a bundled table), but the enum both ends decode has changed shape, so they
/// must agree on it.
/// v31: the full-band panadapter — a new `ServerMsg::WideSpectrum`, carrying an
/// ordinary `SpectrumFrame` on its own lane. Appended at the end of the enum so
/// no existing postcard discriminant moves, but an older client cannot decode
/// the new message, so the handshake has to reject it.
/// v32: engine notices reach remote clients — a new `ServerMsg::Notice`,
/// likewise appended at the end. What a notice says is the operator's business
/// wherever they are sitting: a radio refusing a tune, or an interface that has
/// dropped and is reconnecting, is not a local-console detail.
/// v33: the picture stores moved server-side — five new `ServerMsg`s
/// (`ImagePresets`, `ImageSlotSource`, `ImageListing`, `ImageFile`,
/// `ImageSaved`) and six new `Command`s (`ImageSetSlot`, `ImageClearSlot`,
/// `ImageSetMessage`, `ImageGetSlot`, `ImageList`, `ImageGet`), all appended so
/// no existing discriminant moves. The transmit slots, their overlay messages
/// and the received galleries used to be client state, which meant a browser
/// tab and the console attached to the same radio disagreed about both — and
/// the browser, having no filesystem, had neither. They belong to the radio:
/// the engine owns the files and hands out metadata, thumbnails and pixels on
/// request. Composition stays client-side, and transmit still rides the
/// existing `SstvTx` / `RifpTx`.
/// v34: the station configuration reaches remote clients — two new `ServerMsg`s
/// (`StationConfig`, `TleSubStatus`) and two new `Command`s (`SetSatConfig`,
/// `RefreshTleSubs`), all appended so no existing discriminant moves. The
/// network cockpit, the two built-in servers, the WSJT-X broadcast and the
/// satellite additions all describe the *station*, and all of them are files in
/// the engine host's config directory. A remote settings dialog used to read
/// its own machine's copy — nonexistent in a browser — so those tabs opened on
/// defaults, and pressing APPLY wrote the defaults back over the operator's
/// real configuration. The engine announces them instead, and the server caches
/// and replays them like the digi config.
/// v35: received pictures can be deleted — one new `ServerMsg` (`ImageDeleted`)
/// and one new `Command` (`ImageDelete`), both appended so no existing
/// discriminant moves. The store is on the engine host, so until now the only
/// way to clear out a season of half-decoded charts and noise-only frames was to
/// go to that machine with a file manager; a browser tab could not do it at all.
/// The deletion is broadcast rather than answered, because a picture that has
/// gone is gone from every gallery, not just the one that asked.
/// v36: sign-in — one new `ClientMsg` (`Auth`) and two new `ServerMsg`s
/// (`AuthRequired`, `AuthRejected`), all appended so no existing discriminant
/// moves. A server with credentials configured answers `Hello` with
/// `AuthRequired` instead of `HelloAck` and waits; everything that used to
/// happen next happens after the credentials are accepted. The version still
/// has to be bumped despite the appends: a v35 client cannot decode
/// `AuthRequired`, so it would report a protocol error rather than the truth,
/// which is that it needs a password and cannot ask for one.
/// v37: manual audio gain — `RxState.manual_gain_db` and a new
/// `Command::SetManualGain`, which is *not* appended: it sits with the other
/// receiver commands, so the discriminants after it move. Both ends must agree
/// on the added field anyway, postcard not being self-describing, so the
/// version has to be bumped either way. AGC off used to mean unity gain on the
/// demodulator's own output, which for an SSB signal 60 dB down is silence at
/// any volume setting; it now means this fixed gain instead.
/// v38: a finished FT8/FT4 contact says so — `TranscriptLine` gained `done`,
/// the flag on the line that marks the QSO complete and logged. Appended to the
/// struct, but postcard is not self-describing, so every message carrying a
/// `DigiStatus` changes layout and both ends have to agree on the field.
/// v39: `QsoStep::Done` is gone. Nothing ever set it — `Confirming` is the
/// state a finished contact sits in — so no engine has ever put it on the wire.
/// It was the last variant, so no surviving discriminant moves, but the enum
/// both ends decode has changed shape and this codebase bumps for that.
/// v40: sub-audible squelch signalling on NFM — `Meters.tone` carries the CTCSS
/// tone or DCS code being received, `RxState.tone_sql` the one the operator
/// requires before the audio gate opens, and `Command::SetToneSquelch` sets it.
/// The command is appended, so no surviving discriminant moves, but postcard is
/// not self-describing and the two added struct fields change the layout of
/// every message carrying `RadioState` or `Meters`.
/// v41: the frequency scanner — `RadioState.scan` says whether it is running
/// and whether it has stopped on something, `RadioEvent::Scanner` carries the
/// settings the way `Memories` carries the memory list, and four appended
/// commands (`SetScannerConfig`, `SetScanning`, `ScanNext`, `ScanSkip`) drive
/// it. The commands are appended, but the added `RadioState` field changes the
/// layout of every message carrying one, postcard not being self-describing.
/// v42: recording both sides of the QSO (RX left, TX right) instead of just
/// the receiver, plus an optional mono downmix — `Command::SetRecordingMono`
/// (appended) and `RadioState.recording_mono` (changes the layout of every
/// message carrying `RadioState`).
/// v43: two more noise-reduction engines. `NrLevel` gained
/// `Spec{Low,Med,High}` (a Rust port of libspecbleach's adaptive denoiser) and
/// `Df{Low,Med,High}` (DeepFilterNet3), both appended so no surviving
/// discriminant moves — but a v42 client cannot decode discriminants 7..12 at
/// all, so it would report a protocol error rather than the truth, which is
/// that the operator picked an engine it has never heard of. The `Ai*`
/// variants were also renamed `Rnn*`, which the wire cannot see (postcard is
/// positional and this enum is persisted nowhere else) but the labels can: the
/// chip reads "NR RNN Med" where it read "NR AI Med".
/// v44: WSPR. `Mode::Wspr` is appended, as is `SpotKind::Wspr`, so no surviving
/// discriminant moves — but `DigiConfig` gained five fields and `DigiStatus` a
/// `wspr: Option<WsprStatus>`, and postcard is not self-describing, so every
/// message carrying either changes layout and both ends have to agree. The new
/// `ServerMsg::WsprSpots` carries what a slot decoded: a WSPR reception is a
/// measurement of a path rather than a message somebody sent, so it travels as
/// its own event instead of being squeezed into `Decode`. `WsprStatus` also
/// carries `tx_blocked`, the engine's own answer to "can this station transmit
/// as configured" — the panel used to work that out for itself and got it
/// wrong, and one authority is the point.
/// v45: the CW skimmer's decoder is the operator's choice. `SkimmerSettings`
/// gained `cw_decoder` (DeepCW or the envelope-timing decoder) and `cw_slots`
/// (how many stations the neural one reads at once), so a receiver that cannot
/// spare the cores for a Conformer per station can still skim. Both are
/// appended, but `SkimmerSettings` is a field of `RadioState` as well as the
/// payload of `Command::SetSkimmerConfig`, and postcard is not self-describing:
/// the layout of every state broadcast changes and both ends have to agree.
/// v46: memory folders — `MemoryChannel` gained `folder`, which changes the
/// layout of every `Memories` message, postcard not being self-describing. The
/// folder list itself rides the new `ServerMsg::MemoryFolders` (appended last,
/// so no surviving discriminant moves), and four appended `Command`s
/// (`CreateMemoryFolder` / `RenameMemoryFolder` / `DeleteMemoryFolder` /
/// `MoveMemoryToFolder`) manage them.
/// v47: an RTTY memory carries its modem setup — `MemoryChannel` gained
/// `rtty: Option<RttyMemory>` (baud / shift / reverse / AFC), captured when a
/// memory is stored in RTTY mode and re-applied on recall. Changes the layout
/// of every `Memories` message, postcard not being self-describing.
/// v48: the satellite lock. Two appended `Command`s (`SetSatLock`,
/// `SetRotatorConfig`) and two appended `ServerMsg`s (`SatTrack`,
/// `RotatorStatus`), so no surviving discriminant moves — but `SatLink` gained
/// `inverting` and `StationConfig` gained `rotator`, and postcard is not
/// self-describing, so every message carrying either (`SetSatConfig`, the
/// `StationConfig` bundle) changes layout and both ends have to agree.
///
/// v49: `DeviceCaps` gained `shared_lo_rx` (a Pluto 2R2T's chains share one
/// LO). Appended field, but postcard is not self-describing, so every message
/// carrying capabilities changes layout and both ends have to agree.
/// v50: the band plan became data. `StationConfig` gained `region` (which of
/// the three IARU regions the station is in) and `band_plan` (the edges and
/// sub-segments themselves, from the engine machine's `bandplan.json`), so the
/// bundle changes layout and both ends have to agree. `Command::SetRegion` and
/// `Command::ReloadBandPlan` are appended last, so no surviving discriminant
/// moves.
/// v51: the interface configuration reaches remote clients — a new
/// `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and a new `Command::SetRadioConfig`, both appended
/// last, so no surviving discriminant moves. What an SDR can be told about
/// itself is not all expressible as a gain stage: an RTL-SDR's AGC mode, its
/// ppm correction, its HF path and its bias tee ride `SetGain` pseudo-elements
/// to the running device, but the panel that drives them reads and writes
/// `radio.json` — a file in the engine host's config directory, which a remote
/// client had no copy of and was therefore shown "only available in the native
/// app" instead of. A headless server's dongle could only be configured by
/// editing that file by hand and restarting. The engine announces it instead,
/// and the server caches and replays it like the station config. The version
/// still has to be bumped despite the appends: a v50 client cannot decode the
/// announcement, so it would report a protocol error rather than the truth,
/// which is that the server is offering it something it has never heard of.
/// v52: Winlink radio email. Five appended `Command`s (`WinlinkConnect`,
/// `MailList`, `MailGet`, `MailCompose`, `MailDelete`, `MailMove`) and five
/// appended `ServerMsg`s (`WinlinkStatus`, `MailListing`, `MailMessage`,
/// `MailSaved`, `MailDeleted`), so no surviving discriminant moves — but
/// `NetworkConfig` gained `winlink`, and postcard is not self-describing, so
/// every message carrying it changes layout and both ends have to agree. The
/// mailbox itself stays on the engine host and is read a page and a message at
/// a time, like the picture store: mirroring a mailbox with attachments in it
/// to every client on connect is not something a phone link would survive.
/// v53: AX.25 packet radio. Two appended `Mode` variants — `Packet` (VHF/UHF
/// FM) and `PacketHf` (HF sideband) — so no surviving discriminant moves and a
/// v52 client decodes every mode it already knew. The bump is for the other
/// direction: a v53 engine on a packet mode sends a discriminant a v52 client
/// has never heard of, and postcard is not self-describing, so what it would
/// report is a protocol error rather than the truth. Same reasoning as v51's.
/// `DigiConfig` also gained the `packet_*` settings and `DigiStatus` an
/// `Option<PacketStatus>` carrying the heard list, which changes the layout of
/// every message either of them rides in — the same reason v52 had to bump for
/// `NetworkConfig`. The heard list is capped (`PACKET_HEARD_MAX`) and travels
/// whole rather than as a delta: it is a rolling view of a busy channel, not a
/// log, and a client that reconnects wants what is on the air now.
/// `WinlinkConfig` also gained `lane`, `gateway` and `gateway_via`, so the
/// operator picks the radio lane in settings rather than the client picking it
/// per connect — which keeps `Command::WinlinkConnect` unchanged and means an
/// older client still forwards by telnet instead of failing to encode a command
/// it has never heard of.
/// v54: the 4 m band. `Band::M4` is appended to the enum, so no postcard
/// discriminant moves and every band stack and memory already on disk still
/// decodes — but `Band::ALL` puts it between 6 m and 2 m, where it belongs on
/// screen, and that list's *position* is what the propagation messages index by
/// (`SolarServerMsg`'s per-band planes, and the band masks the globe and map
/// carry). A v53 client would file 2 m's plane under 4 m and 70 cm's under 2 m,
/// which is the one thing a version byte exists to prevent.
/// v55: SpyServer, as two interfaces. `Backend::SpyServer` and
/// `Backend::SpyServerVfo` are appended so no existing discriminant moves, and
/// `RadioConfig` gained a `spyserver` and a `spyserver_vfo` block. Both halves
/// force the bump, for the two reasons v51 and v53 already set out: a new
/// `Backend` discriminant is a value a v54 client has never heard of, and two
/// new `RadioConfig` fields change the layout of every message that struct
/// rides in — which is `ServerMsg::RadioConfig`, the message the settings
/// dialog is built from. Postcard is not self-describing, so a v54 client
/// would not fail to find them; it would decode the fields after them from the
/// wrong offset.
/// v56: device questions travel. A new `ClientMsg::Probe` and a new
/// `ServerMsg::ProbeAnswer`, both appended last, so no surviving discriminant
/// moves. Every other setting in `radio.json` describes a device and therefore
/// means the same thing wherever it is read; the discovery controls beside them
/// ask about a *machine* — what is on its USB bus, which serial ports it has,
/// what a broadcast finds on its network, which sound cards the rig could be
/// plugged into — and a client that answered those locally would be describing
/// the wrong computer. So they were greyed out, and with them the interface
/// selector: with no list to pick from there was nothing to choose. Now the
/// question is asked of the machine the radio is attached to and the answer
/// comes back over the session, which is what makes changing the radio on a
/// `--server` instance possible from a remote or browser client at all. The
/// version bump is for the usual reason: a v55 client cannot decode an answer
/// it has never heard of, and would report a protocol error instead of the
/// truth, which is that the server is offering it something new. `ServerMsg`
/// also gained `Capabilities`, appended after it: with the interface
/// changeable from a client, the radio a session is talking to can become a
/// different one mid-session, and what it can do has to follow.
///
/// **57** — a station serves every radio in its roster, each on its own
/// address, so a session now says which radio it is on and what else the
/// station has: [`ServerMsg::Radios`], sent once, right after `HelloAck`.
/// Without it a client could reach a second radio only if somebody typed its
/// address in by hand, and could never put the station's radios in tabs the
/// way it does with the ones plugged into this machine.
/// **58** — RDS/RBDS on WFM broadcast: [`ServerMsg::Rds`], appended last. A
/// remote client gets the station name, programme type, radio text and
/// now-playing tags the same way the local one does, because the decoding
/// happens where the radio is and only the result travels. Cached and replayed
/// on connect like the other announced-once state: the station being listened to
/// is a *condition*, not an event, and a browser tab that attaches after the
/// dial stopped moving would otherwise sit blank until the text next changed.
///
/// **59** — an RMS gateway carries its own speed and channel. `WinlinkConfig`
/// gained `gateway_baud` and `gateway_freq_hz`, so picking a 9600 gateway from
/// the list calls it at 9600 instead of in silence at 1200. `WinlinkConfig`
/// travels inside `Command::SetNetworkConfig`, and postcard is not
/// self-describing: two appended fields shift every byte after them, so a v58
/// client and a v59 server would disagree about where the gateway list starts.
/// `#[serde(default)]` covers the config file on disk, not the wire — hence
/// the bump.
///
/// **60** — the microwave bands: 1.25 m and 33 cm (Region 2's alone, like 4 m is
/// Region 1's), and 23 cm, 13 cm, 9 cm and 6 cm. `Band::M125`, `Band::Cm33`,
/// `Band::Cm23`, `Band::Cm13`, `Band::Cm9` and `Band::Cm6` are appended to the
/// enum, so no postcard discriminant moves and every band stack and memory
/// already on disk still decodes. The bump is for the same reason v54's was:
/// `Band::ALL` puts each new band where it belongs on screen — 1.25 m between
/// 2 m and 70 cm, the rest above it — and that list's *position* is what the
/// propagation messages index by (`SolarServerMsg`'s per-band planes, and the
/// band masks the globe and the flat map carry). A v59 client would file 70 cm's
/// plane under 1.25 m and every plane above it one band low.
///
/// **61** — a second radio used as this one's panadapter. `DeviceCaps` gained
/// `rx_audio_external` and `RadioConfig` gained a whole `panadapter` block, and
/// both travel over the wire — `DeviceCaps` in `ServerMsg::Capabilities`,
/// `RadioConfig` in `ServerMsg::RadioConfig` and `Command::SetRadioConfig`.
/// Both are appended last, so nothing already on disk moves, but postcard is
/// positional and not self-describing: a v60 client reading a v61
/// `RadioConfig` would run off the end of the message, and `#[serde(default)]`
/// covers the file, not the stream.
///
/// **62** — the panadapter's gestures say so. `Command::TuneInSpan` is appended
/// last, so no surviving discriminant moves, but a v61 engine would answer a
/// command it cannot decode with a protocol error. It separates tuning inside
/// the span already on screen (click, drag, wheel on the panadapter) from
/// setting the dial (`Command::SetVfo` — the readout, a memory, an external
/// controller), which are the same thing on an SDR and are not on a rig whose
/// own synthesiser is the centre of what we capture. (The semantic split has
/// since been retired — the engine answers both commands identically, see
/// `Command::TuneInSpan` — but the discriminant is on the wire and stays.)
///
/// **63** — the ISM decoder. `RadioState` gained an `ism` block, which puts it in
/// *every* state broadcast, so this is not an append a v62 client can survive:
/// it would run off the end of the first state message it received. The new
/// `ServerMsg::IsmReports` / `IsmStatus` and `Command::SetIsmConfig` are appended
/// last as usual. `IsmSettings` carries its per-family switches as a bitmask
/// rather than a fixed-length array precisely so that the *next* protocol family
/// added does not force this bump again.
///
/// **64** — the ELAD backend. `Backend`, `DeviceProbe`, `ProbeAnswer` and
/// `ReportKind` each gained a variant and `RadioConfig` an `elad` block. All
/// appends, but a v63 client asked to decode the new `Backend::Elad` — or handed
/// a `RadioConfig` with one more field on the end — has nowhere to put it, and
/// the config is what a client reads to draw the settings dialog.
///
/// **65** — the LimeSDR backend and LimeRFE control. `Backend`, `DeviceProbe`,
/// `ProbeAnswer` and `ReportKind` each gained a variant and `RadioConfig` a
/// `lime` block, which carries a nested `LimeRfeConfig` of its own. Appends
/// again, and again not survivable: a v64 client handed a `RadioConfig` with
/// the new block on the end stops at the wrong byte, and the LimeRFE settings
/// it cannot decode are the ones that decide whether an amplifier is switched
/// into the transmit path.
///
/// **66** — the transmit tone can be held. `DigiConfig` gained `hold_tx_freq`,
/// and `DigiConfig` travels inside `DigiStatus`, so this is not an append a v65
/// client can survive: postcard is positional and every field after it shifts.
/// `#[serde(default)]` covers the config file on disk, not the wire. The engine
/// gained `Settings.tx_guard_offset`, but that is local and not on the wire.
///
/// **67** — the transmit tone is remembered per band. `DigiConfig` gained
/// `tx_audio_hz`, a map from `Band` to the offset last chosen there, and the
/// same reasoning as 66 applies unchanged: it sits inside `DigiStatus`,
/// postcard is positional, and a v66 client reading a v67 status runs into the
/// wrong field. `#[serde(default)]` again covers the config file and not the
/// wire. The engine's `digi_tx_band` is local state and is not sent.
///
/// **68** — the rig's own power-output meter. `TxMeters` gained `po`, a
/// `0.0..=1.0` fraction of the rig's own scale, and `TxMeters` is not the last
/// field of `Meters`: `stereo` and `tone` follow it. So this is not even an
/// append a client can stop short of — every byte after `tx` shifts, and a v67
/// client handed a v68 `Meters` with the transmitter keyed reads the new
/// `Option` tag as `stereo` and then runs off the end of the message. Same
/// reasoning as v27 and v40, which bumped for exactly this struct.
///
/// The ALC reading that landed alongside it is NOT a wire change: it went into
/// `TxTelemetry`, which the engine folds into `TxMeters::alc` — an existing
/// field — and which never leaves the process on its own.
///
/// **69** — the SoapySDR settings panel. `DeviceCaps` gained `bandwidths`,
/// `bandwidth_ranges` and `settings`, so that a driver's own controls can be
/// drawn from what the device says about itself rather than from per-driver
/// code. They are appended last and `#[serde(default)]`, but postcard is not
/// self-describing and `DeviceCaps` is sent whole: a v68 client would stop
/// reading where the struct used to end and treat the remainder as the next

/// reuses `IsmReports`, `IsmStatus` and `SetIsmConfig`.
///
/// **73** — the station's roster is editable from a client. Three appended
/// `ClientMsg`s (`AddRadio`, `RemoveRadio`, `RenameRadio`), which alone would

///
/// **74** — HamQTH joins eQSL/QRZ/Club Log as an upload target. Two appended
/// fields and two appended variants, and the fields are what force the bump:
/// `NetworkConfig` gained `auto_upload_hamqth` and `QsoRecord` gained
/// `hamqth_sent`, both of which ride whole inside `Command::SetNetworkConfig`

///
/// **75** — a radio's power switch reaches a client. `RadioInfo` gained
/// `enabled`, and it rides inside `ServerMsg::Radios` ahead of that message's

/// did not was doing it from away, which meant the browser client — a headless
/// station's *only* screen — could not put a radio down and pick it back up.
///
/// **76** — a stored memory can be edited (issue #138).
/// `Command::EditMemory` carries the channel's new name, dial and mode.
/// Appended last, so no surviving discriminant moves and a v75 *engine* would
/// simply never be sent one — but the handshake is an equality test, and the

/// mean deleting the memory and storing it again from the frequency itself.
///
/// The sort that landed with it is not on the wire at all: which order a

/// store keeps them in the order they were stored, and the engine is never

///
/// **77** — repeater operation (issue #137). [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`]
/// carries a `RepeaterState`: the transmit shift, the CTCSS/DCS tone that goes
/// out under the voice, and the 1750 Hz burst. `Command::SetRepeater` and
/// `Command::ToneBurst` set and fire them, `Command::EditMemory` gained the
/// setup a memory stores, and `MemoryChannel` gained the field it stores it in.
///
/// A field added to a struct in the state, so this is not a variant append that
/// an older peer could simply never be sent: a v76 client decoding a v77 state
/// would read the tail of it as garbage. The handshake is an equality test and
/// catches that before a single frame is exchanged, which is what it is for.
/// **78** — the ISM decoder's rtl_433 lane gained a chosen bandwidth and a
/// fifth band (issue #141). `Rtl433Settings` carries `bandwidth_hz`, which is
/// the width to watch or zero for the band's own, and `Rtl433Status` carries
/// `rate_hz`, the width actually being decoded. Both are fields added to
/// structs — the settings ride in [`sdroxide_types::RadioState`] and the status
/// in an event — so a v77 peer would read the tail of either as garbage, and
/// the handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// The 345 MHz band itself is not on the wire: it is a row in a table both
/// sides already have.
///
/// **79** — dragging the panadapter past the end of the captured window moves
/// the window (issue #133). [`sdroxide_types::DeviceCaps`] carries
/// `center_is_dial`, which says whether the front end has a centre that can be
/// commanded on its own; a client needs it to know whether the pan may ask for
/// one, or whether the dial it is already turning moves the window by itself.
/// A field appended to a struct that rides in an event, so a v78 client would
/// read the tail of the capabilities as garbage — the handshake's equality test
/// is what stops it trying.
///
/// **80** — the banner across the top of a transmitted SSTV/RIFP picture is
/// the operator's to write (issue #145). [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] gained
/// `sstv_banner`, `sstv_banner_left`, `sstv_banner_right`, `sstv_banner_fill`,
/// `sstv_banner_ink` and `sstv_banner_height`: what the strip prints at each
/// end, what colour it and its text are, and how tall it is. The two texts
/// carry `{call}` / `{grid}` / `{version}` placeholders, resolved by whichever
/// client composes the picture.
///
/// On the station rather than in this screen's `UiSettings`, where the
/// waterfall's own colours live, because this one is drawn *into* the picture
/// that goes on the air — it is the station identifying itself, and the
/// browser tab and the console have to compose the same slot identically.
///
/// Fields added to a struct that rides in both a command and an event, so a
/// v79 peer would read the tail of either as garbage; the handshake's equality
/// test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **81** — the HydraSDR RFOne is an interface of its own (issue #144).
/// [`sdroxide_types::Backend`] gained `HydraSdr` and
/// [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`] a `hydrasdr` block, with `DeviceProbe`,
/// `ProbeAnswer` and `ReportKind` gaining the variants that enumerate one and
/// fetch its session trace.
///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v80 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying. The new `Backend` variant
/// on its own would have been harmless (an older peer is simply never sent
/// one); the config block is not.
///
/// **82** — a LimeSDR's second receive chain can carry a second aerial, and
/// the two are combined (issue #98). [`sdroxide_types::LimeConfig`] gained an
/// `aux` block — [`sdroxide_types::LimeAuxConfig`] — carrying what the chain is
/// for, its socket and gain, and the adaptive filter's mode, length, rate and
/// hold.
///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v81 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
/// **83** — that second chain can instead carry a directional coupler, and
/// linearise the transmitter from a sample of what it emitted — PureSignal
/// (issue #98). [`sdroxide_types::LimeAuxRole`] gained a `PureSignal` variant
/// and [`sdroxide_types::LimeAuxConfig`] the `ps_bins`, `ps_rate` and
/// `ps_frozen` that drive the correction.
///
/// Fields appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v82 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying. The new role variant
/// would have been survivable on its own; the fields are not.
///
/// **84** — a PlutoSDR can key an external amplifier, LNA or transmit-receive
/// switch from its own GPO pins (issue #135). [`sdroxide_types::PlutoConfig`]
/// gained `duplex` ([`sdroxide_types::PlutoDuplex`]) and `ptt_gpo`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::PlutoPtt`]): which duplex the AD9361's enable state
/// machine runs in, and which pair of pins follows the radio.
///
/// Fields appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v83 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
/// v85: DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) — `Mode::Drm`, `ServerMsg::Drm` carrying
/// `DrmStatus`, and `Command::SetDrmService` / `SetDrmConstellation`. All are
/// appended, so no existing discriminant moves.
///
/// **86** — a rig's I/Q sound card gets the front-end correction every other
/// quadrature interface here already had (issue #147).
/// [`sdroxide_types::CatConfig`] gained `iq_correction` and `iq_dc_block_hz`:
/// whether the mirror image and the DC spike are cancelled, and how wide a
/// notch to take out of the centre.
///
/// Fields in the radio configuration, which rides in both a command and an
/// event, so a v85 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **87** — an RSPduo can run *both* of its tuners and combine them, the same
/// way a LimeSDR's second chain is combined at v82 (issue #153).
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayConfig`] gained a `diversity` block —
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDiversity`] — carrying whether the second tuner
/// runs at all, its own two gains, and the adaptive filter's mode, length,
/// rate and hold.
///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v86 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **88** — QRP Labs radios (QMX, QMX+, QDX) are a CAT family of their own
/// (issue #95). [`sdroxide_types::CatFamily`] gained a trailing `QrpLabs`
/// variant.
///
/// Nothing moved: postcard numbers variants by declaration index and the new
/// one went on the end, so every existing family keeps its number and a v87
/// peer's own configuration still round-trips. What forces the bump is the
/// other direction — a v87 client handed `QrpLabs` has no such variant to put
/// it in, and postcard is not self-describing, so it does not fail on the field
/// but on everything after it. Same reasoning as v72's `IsmProtocol` append.
///
/// **89** — APRS is a mode of its own (issue #150). Three appends, all at the
/// tail of their type: [`sdroxide_types::Mode`] gained `Aprs`,
/// [`sdroxide_types::Command`] gained `AprsBeacon` and `AprsSendMessage`, and
/// [`sdroxide_types::DigiStatus`] gained an `aprs` field carrying the map, the
/// messages and the channel.
///
/// The `Mode` append is the one that forces the bump, and it is the same trap
/// as v88's: postcard numbers variants by declaration index, so every existing
/// mode keeps its number — but a v88 client handed `Aprs` has no variant to
/// decode it into and desynchronises on everything after it, rather than
/// failing on the field itself.
///
/// **90** — the RSPduo's diversity filter (v87) gains two more ways to find
/// its combining weight, alongside the original adaptive one (issue #153).
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDiversity`] gained `technique`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::DiversityTechnique`]: `Adaptive`, `Decorrelate`, or
/// `WidebandDecorrelate`) and `gate_db`, both appended at the tail of the
/// struct for the same reason `enabled`'s siblings originally landed in
/// declaration order — a field-order slip in a positional wire format
/// reconfigures the wrong setting rather than failing outright.
///
/// A field appended to the radio configuration, which rides in both a command
/// and an event, so a v89 peer would read the tail of either as garbage — the
/// handshake's equality test is what stops it trying.
///
/// **91** — a Reuter RSR200(B) can be driven over its LAN interface
/// (`RSR200_PLAN.md` step 3; issue #153's own hardware-diversity plan next
/// to it). [`sdroxide_types::Backend`] gained `Rsr200`, appended last for
/// the same reason every backend before it did; [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig`]
/// gained `rsr200: `[`sdroxide_types::Rsr200Config`]`, appended after
/// `hydrasdr` for the same reason as every field above it. Only the LAN
/// transport, single channel, 16-bit exist behind this so far.
///
/// The `Backend` append is what forces the bump (postcard numbers variants
/// by declaration index, so a v90 peer handed `Rsr200` has no variant to
/// decode it into); the `RadioConfig` field append is the same positional
/// trap as every other config field before it.
///
/// **92** — the RSR200 (v91) gains its second transport: USB over FTDI's
/// D3XX driver, alongside the original LAN one (`RSR200_PLAN.md` step 7).
/// One config for both, not a second `Backend` — the same physical radio,
/// the same command protocol either way, differing only in framing, so a
/// transport choice belongs inside [`sdroxide_types::Rsr200Config`] rather
/// than duplicating the whole registration the way `RtlSdr`/`RtlTcp` do for
/// a genuinely different remote server. `Rsr200Config` gained `transport`
/// ([`sdroxide_types::Rsr200Transport`]: `Lan` or `Usb`) and `usb_serial`,
/// both appended at the tail for the same positional reason as every field
/// above them — a v91 peer would read either as garbage past the end of
/// `attenuator2`, not fail outright.
///
/// **93** — the RSR200 (v91/92) gains Separate mode: both ADCs, combined in
/// software by `sdroxide_dsp::Diversity` exactly the way the SDRplay
/// RSPduo's own second-tuner mode already does (`RSR200_PLAN.md` §3, step
/// 4 — no changes to `sdroxide-dsp` needed, genuine reuse). `Rsr200Config`
/// gained `channel_mode` ([`sdroxide_types::Rsr200ChannelMode`]: `Single` or
/// `Separate`) and `diversity` ([`sdroxide_types::Rsr200Diversity`] —
/// mode/taps/rate/frozen/technique/gate_db, the same shape as
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDiversity`]'s own filter settings minus its two
/// SDRplay-specific second-tuner gain fields), both appended at the tail for
/// the same positional reason as every field above them.
///
/// **94** — the RSR200 (v91–93) gains a 24-bit sample width alongside its
/// original 16-bit one (`RSR200_PLAN.md` step 5). The wire-geometry and
/// unpacking math for both widths was already built and tested in step 1
/// (`sdroxide_rsr200::protocol`); this only exposes the choice.
/// `Rsr200Config` gained `bits24: bool`, appended at the tail for the same
/// positional reason as every field above it.
///
/// **95** — the RSR200 (v91–94) gains hardware diversity: the radio's own
/// combiner, `OpMode::Diversity` on the wire, as opposed to the software
/// filter v93 already added (`RSR200_PLAN.md` step 6 — the last of the
/// plan's eight steps to be built). [`sdroxide_types::Rsr200ChannelMode`]
/// gained `HardwareDiversity`, appended last for the same reason every enum
/// append before it was — a v94 peer handed this variant has none to decode
/// it into. `Rsr200Config` gained `hw_div_magnitude`/`hw_div_phase_deg`
/// (`f64`), appended at the tail for the same positional reason as every
/// field above them.
///
/// **96** — the RSR200 (v91–95) gains its last plan step: Serial mode,
/// automatic attenuator control, VHF/preamp antenna-input switching, and
/// swap-channels (`RSR200_PLAN.md` step 8, the last of the plan's eight
/// steps). [`sdroxide_types::Rsr200ChannelMode`] gained `Serial`, appended
/// last for the same reason every enum append before it was. `Rsr200Config`
/// gained eight fields — `use_vhf`, `vhf_preamp`, `swap_channels`,
/// `upper_sideband` (all `bool`), `auto_att_threshold` (`i32`),
/// `auto_att_hold_time_sec` (`f64`), `auto_att_gain_ch1`/`auto_att_gain_ch2`
/// (`f32`) — appended at the tail for the same positional reason as every
/// field above them. This step also fixed two real bugs found by reading the
/// radio's own protocol documentation rather than assuming: `stream.rs` was
/// sending `OpMode::Independent` for `Single` channel mode, a
/// documented-invalid combination (it requires the dual-channel wire
/// format); and `SW_ADC2_TO_HF2` was never being set for `Separate`/
/// `HardwareDiversity` mode, so ADC2 stayed on the radio's power-on default
/// of listening to the same HF1 connector as ADC1 rather than the genuinely
/// separate HF2 antenna those modes are for. Neither bug touches the wire
/// format this proto crate carries — both are pure device-command
/// corrections inside `sdroxide-rsr200` — but they materially change what
/// "confirmed on air" meant for every earlier diversity test, which is why
/// they're recorded here alongside the version that actually shipped the
/// fix.
///
/// **97** — both [`sdroxide_types::Rsr200Diversity`] and
/// [`sdroxide_types::SdrPlayDiversity`] gain `ref_band_enabled` (`bool`),
/// `ref_band_freq_hz`/`ref_band_width_hz` (`f64`), appended at the tail of
/// each for the same positional reason as every field above them — a
/// reference-band restriction for `DiversityTechnique::Decorrelate`'s
/// covariance solve, ported from the SDR++ sibling implementation's own
/// `dsp::combine::RefBand`. Motivated by a real-air A/B the same day: on
/// identical antennas and frequency (820 kHz, WNYC), sdroxide's whole-span
/// Decorrelate left far more of the interferer audible than the SDR++
/// sibling's own reference-band-restricted solve — the whole-span solve
/// nulls whatever is loudest and most correlated across the *entire*
/// received span, which is not necessarily the specific signal the operator
/// is pointed at. Restricting the covariance measurement to a chosen slice
/// of spectrum fixes that; `sdroxide-dsp`'s own new
/// `a_reference_band_nulls_the_weak_interferer_the_whole_span_solve_misses`
/// test reproduces the failure and the fix synthetically.
