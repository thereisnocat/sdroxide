//! What level a digital over reaches the radio at.
//!
//! Field report ([issue #131]): a Kenwood on its I/Q output made 100 % of its
//! power under TUNE and a quarter of it on FT8, with the Drive slider moving
//! nothing. The rig modulates the audio we send it, and the modems synthesise
//! their modulating signal at half scale — 6 dB of headroom that belongs to the
//! modem's own arithmetic, not to the transmitter. Nothing divided it out
//! again, so the radio was asked for a quarter of the power a TUNE at the same
//! slider setting asks for, and no power command could make up the difference:
//! the output was riding on the audio, not on the power register.
//!
//! So the two levels are compared against each other rather than against a
//! constant. Whatever a tune tone is worth to a rig, a digital over has to be
//! worth the same.

// having none; the single test that genuinely needs an absent entry owns a mode
