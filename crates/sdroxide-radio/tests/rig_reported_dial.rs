//! A rig that reports its own dial *and* is the front end.
//!
//! A transceiver whose I/Q output goes into a sound card (a KX3, a K3 with the
//! I/Q tap) is not an SDR with a rig beside it: its synthesiser is the centre of
//! the baseband we capture. Turning its knob moves the spectrum as surely as it
//! moves the readout, so the engine has to adopt the new centre when the rig
//! reports one — otherwise the window keeps the old axis, the waterfall shows
//! content that no longer matches its labels, and the DDC, left on the offset
//! between a stale centre and the new VFO, demodulates somewhere else again.
//!
//! It runs the other way too. Setting the dial here — the readout, a memory, an
//! external controller, a click on the picture — has to move the radio, or its
//! readout and ours show different frequencies with nothing to reconcile them
//! until the next thing it reports snaps ours back to its. The click used to be
//! exempt (the signal is already in the baseband, so only our receiver moved)
//! until a field report showed where the exemption transmits: CW keyed as text
//! through the rig's own keyer, and a mic keyed at the radio, both go out on
//! the dial the click left behind. So [`Command::TuneInSpan`] follows the dial
//! exactly as `SetVfo` does — and on a radio whose window is its own, both
//! still leave the hardware alone while the VFO stays inside the span.
//!
//! CW is where the two numbers stop being one. sdroxide's CW dial is a
//! zero-beat and the tone being copied sits a sidetone pitch above it, while a
//! transceiver in CW keys its own transmitter on its VFO — so on a radio whose
//! I/Q comes out on that VFO, the VFO belongs on the station and the dial a
//! pitch under it, or every over goes out a sidetone low and nobody answers
//! (issue #170). A radio that shifts its own I.F. by the pitch instead has
//! already done that arithmetic and is left alone; the source says which it is.
//!
//! All of which needs a dial that answers. A transceiver sending I/Q down a
//! sound card with no control cable on it has one synthesiser and no way to
//! command it, so the last two tests here hold the other end of the same
//! contract: with no link the engine tunes inside the span the radio is
//! already sending (issue #155 — commanding a dial nothing hears relabelled
//! the picture and left the receiver unable to change station at all), and a
//! link that comes up later takes the dial straight back.
