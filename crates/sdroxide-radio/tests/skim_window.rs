//! Where the skimmers listen on a front end wider than their window.
//!
//! The window is 192 kHz of a stream that may be thirty megahertz wide, and it
//! used to be pinned to the hardware centre. On a receiver whose span is a band
//! that is the same place the operator is looking; on an RX-888 handing over the
//! whole of HF it is the middle of the sampled span and nothing else — so the
//! skimmers ran, cost their CPU, and decoded nothing at all, while the waterfall
//! plainly showed a band full of CW.
//!
//! So the window follows the waterfall. This walks the whole chain: a station is
//! keyed well away from the hardware centre, the client says what it is looking
//! at, and a spot has to come back with the callsign on it — which it can only
//! do if the window was placed on the view, mixed onto it, and left there.
