//! A front end whose samples arrive later than the command that moved them.
//!
//! A retune is a command, not an event. The engine learns the new centre the
//! instant `set_center_hz` returns, but the pipeline behind it is still full of
//! samples taken at the old one — 131 ms of them, measured on a SunSDR2DX
//! through ExpertSDR3's TCI. Label those with the new centre and every signal
//! in them is drawn at the wrong frequency, displaced by however far the centre
//! moved in the meantime.
//!
//! Standing still nobody would ever see it: the centre stops moving and the
//! picture catches up within one delay. It is a **drag** that makes it visible,
//! because with the view fully zoomed out a pan sends `SetCenter` once per
//! displayed frame (issue #133) — so the label runs continuously ahead of the
//! data, and the whole spectrum sits displaced in the direction of the drag
//! until the operator lets go and it snaps back.
//!
//! The source below is the honest version of that rig: it answers with the tone
//! as it stood at the centre in force `DELAY` ago.
