//! What the panadapter resolves has to follow the window on screen, not the
//! width the front end happens to be streaming.
//!
//! The device-wide analyser is a fixed number of bins across the whole stream,
//! so the further in the operator zooms the fewer of them land on screen. On a
//! narrow front end that never bites; on a wide one it bites almost at once. An
//! RX-888 asked for 8.1 MHz gives 247 Hz a bin through the largest FFT the
//! display will ask for, so a 68 kHz window on screen was drawn out of 275
//! numbers and stair-stepped visibly. Front-end decimation was the only cure,
//! and it buys the resolution by throwing the rest of the band away.
//!
//! So a viewport the device-wide analyser can no longer fill is served from a
//! zoom lane instead: the window mixed down and decimated to its own width,
//! analysed there. These tests pin the two halves of that — the resolution it
//! is for, and the frequency accuracy that makes the resolution worth having.
