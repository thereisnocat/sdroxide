//! The handles the rest of the program holds, and the accounting behind them.
//!
//! Same shape as the RTL-SDR and RX-888 backends: a control thread owns the
//! device session, control goes in over a crossbeam channel, samples come
//! back out through an `rtrb` ring of interleaved `f32`. The one structural
//! difference is that samples are not pulled off a USB endpoint here — the
//! vendor service pushes them into a callback on a thread it owns.
//!
//! # One device, one or two streams
//!
//! An RSPduo running both tuners is one API session with two of everything
//! downstream of the ADC, and the two can be separate radios on separate
//! frequencies (issue #165). So the session and the stream are two objects:
//! [`SdrPlayDevice`] owns the thread and the device, and each
//! [`SdrPlayHandle`] is one tuner's stream on it — its own ring, its own
//! dial, its own gains. The device stays open while any stream holds it and
//! closes when the last one goes, which is what lets one radio be reopened
//! (Settings → Apply) without disturbing the other.
//!
//! Every control therefore names a tuner. The exception is the handful the
//! hardware has one of — the reference trim, and on an RSPdx the HDR path —
//! which are marked where they appear.
