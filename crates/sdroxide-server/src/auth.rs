//! The sign-in gate every remote connection passes through.
//!
//! Two rules, and they are the whole design:
//!
//! * **One attempt at a time, server-wide.** Guessing a password is only
//!   practical if guesses can be made in parallel, so they cannot be: every
//!   attempt on every socket queues for the same turnstile. Whoever finds it
//!   occupied is told to come back rather than being parked on it, so the queue
//!   cannot be made to grow either.
//! * **A wrong answer shuts the door for [`LOCKOUT`].** The next attempt — from
//!   anyone — waits that long before it is judged. Combined with the first rule
//!   that caps the whole server at one guess every three seconds, which turns a
//!   dictionary run into a project measured in years and makes the wall-clock
//!   cost of a wrong guess enormously larger than any timing difference inside
//!   the comparison.
//!
//! The cost is deliberate and worth naming: while an attack is running, an
//! operator signing in legitimately waits their turn too. That is the trade a
//! shared lockout makes, and for a single-radio station it is the right way
//! round — a few seconds of delay against somebody else keying the transmitter.
