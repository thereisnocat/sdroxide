//! Server mode: HTTP (static WASM client) + a WebSocket session per radio,
//! speaking `sdroxide-proto`.
//!
//! One session per radio, and one client per session: `/ws` is the station's
//! first radio — all a single-radio station has, and all a client that knows
//! nothing of a roster ever asks for — while `/ws/<id>` names any of them.
//! `/radios` lists what is on offer.
//!
//! Lanes into the socket (per the project plan):
//! - control/state/memories/meters: reliable queue, never intentionally dropped
//! - spectrum: latest-wins watch channel (slow socket → lower fps, no lag)
//! - audio: small bounded queue, drops blocks when the socket can't keep up
//!
//! A pump thread bridges the engine's sync endpoints (crossbeam events,
//! triple-buffered spectrum, rtrb audio) into those async lanes and caches
//! the latest state/caps/memories so a new session can be greeted instantly.
