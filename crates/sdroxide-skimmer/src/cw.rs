//! The CW skimmer core: a streaming STFT over a wide complex-baseband window,
//! per-bin on/off-keying envelope detection with an adaptive noise floor, and
//! light signal tracking. Produces one [`SkimmerSpot`] per tracked CW signal.
//!
//! Finding the signals and reading them are two separate jobs here, and only the
//! second one changed when DeepCW arrived. The STFT below still decides where
//! the stations are, how strong they are and what frequency to put the marker
//! on — all of which it does from bin power alone, and none of which a character
//! model has an opinion about. The text comes from [`crate::deep`], which lifts
//! each station's slice out of a second transform at the model's own resolution
//! and hands it to a pool of decoders.
