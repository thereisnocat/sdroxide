//! Native SmartSDR (FlexRadio FLEX-6000 / FLEX-8000) support — both halves.
//!
//! NATIVE ONLY. Plain `std` TCP/UDP sockets; this crate must never be a
//! dependency of any wasm-targeted crate.
//!
//! - [`FlexHandle`] is the **client**: sdroxide operating a FlexRadio. Receive is
//!   wideband IQ over a DAX IQ stream (sdroxide demodulates); transmit is audio
//!   over a DAX TX stream (the radio modulates it). Control rides the ASCII
//!   command protocol on TCP 4992.
//! - [`discovery`] finds radios, which announce themselves on UDP 4992 without
//!   being asked.
//! - [`sim`] is a **wire-level radio simulator** — real sockets, real protocol —
//!   so the client can be developed and tested with no radio present.
//! - [`protocol`] holds the wire format all three share.
//! - [`trace`] records a session in a form a user can paste into a bug report.
//!
//! # Protocol reference
//!
//! The wire format is documented from AetherSDR's C++ implementation
//! (GPL-3.0-or-later, as is this crate) and from FlexLib's published behaviour.
//! No code is shared; the formats are. Three of AetherSDR's hard-won details are
//! reproduced here because a simulator cannot discover them:
//!
//! - the UDP registration datagram goes to the radio's *control* port and must
//!   be **repeated** until packets come back, because firmware speaking protocol
//!   v1.4.0.0 may not honour `client udpport` at all;
//! - a freshly created panadapter needs a moment before it will accept
//!   configuration, and the `daxiq_channel` binding is one of the sets that goes
//!   missing if it does not get one;
//! - a GUI client id is worth checking against the radio's live client list
//!   before registering it, because a duplicate is resolved by eviction rather
//!   than by refusal.
//!
//! # Diagnostics
//!
//! Nothing here has been run against real hardware — see the
//! [`FIELD_REPORT_HINT`], and note that the simulator agrees with the client by
//! construction, so its passing is evidence about self-consistency and nothing
//! else. [`sim::SimConfig`] therefore carries the failure modes a real radio has
//! shown (`require_udp_register`, `unbound_dax_iq`, `existing_clients`,
//! `evict_after`); a fault worth fixing is worth teaching the simulator first.
//!
//! Every connection therefore carries a [`trace::Trace`]
//! that is always on and costs nothing to enable, and
//! [`FlexHandle::trace`]`.dump()` renders it as one block of text. `tracing`
//! targets `smartsdr`, `smartsdr::control` and `smartsdr::vita` carry the same
//! material for anyone who prefers to filter it live.
