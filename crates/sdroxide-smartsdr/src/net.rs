//! The SmartSDR client: two threads behind one [`FlexHandle`].
//!
//! - **Control** owns the TCP socket on port 4992. It runs the connect
//!   handshake, sends sequenced commands, matches replies to them, and turns
//!   status lines into [`FlexUpdate`]s.
//! - **Data** owns a UDP socket the radio streams VITA-49 packets to. It pushes
//!   DAX IQ into the RX ring, drains the TX ring into DAX audio packets, and
//!   tracks meters.
//!
//! Three ports, not one, and they are easy to confuse: TCP 4992 is the control
//! protocol, UDP 4992 is discovery *and* the socket that learns our return
//! address from a registration datagram, and UDP [`VITA_PORT`] (4991) is the
//! data plane the radio streams from and takes transmit audio on. Our own
//! receiving port is ephemeral, named to the radio with `client udpport`.
//!
//! # Why DAX IQ and not the panadapter
//!
//! A FLEX will hand out either finished FFT bins plus demodulated audio (what
//! SmartSDR itself renders) or raw complex baseband over a DAX IQ stream.
//! sdroxide has its own DDC, demodulators, waterfall, skimmer and digital
//! modes; feeding them radio-side FFT bins would leave all of that unused and
//! limit reception to whatever the radio already decided to demodulate. So the
//! IQ stream is the data path, exactly as for TCI and HPSDR, and the radio's own
//! slice follows our dial rather than the other way round.
//!
//! The cost is bandwidth: DAX IQ tops out at 192 kHz, so that is this backend's
//! widest span.
