//! A self-contained session trace, so a user with a radio can produce a report
//! that a developer without one can read.
//!
//! Everything here also goes to `tracing`, but `tracing` is the wrong shape for
//! a bug report: it needs `RUST_LOG` set before the run, it interleaves with
//! every other subsystem, and asking somebody to reproduce a connect failure
//! with the right filter is asking them to reproduce it twice. A [`Trace`] is
//! always on, bounded, and dumps as one text block.
//!
//! # What it records
//!
//! Every control line in both directions, the first packet of each VITA-49
//! stream with its decoded header, and a periodic counter summary per stream.
//! Full packet bodies are *not* recorded — a 192 kHz IQ stream is 1.5 MB/s, and
//! the header plus the counters is what actually diagnoses a fault.
//!
//! # What it deliberately drops
//!
//! The line buffer is a ring: a long session keeps the most recent
//! [`Trace::CAPACITY`] lines and reports how many it discarded. A trace that
//! grew without bound would either exhaust memory on a radio that reconnects in
//! a loop — which is exactly the fault worth tracing — or force a size cap that
//! silently truncated the interesting end.
