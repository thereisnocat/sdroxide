//! ADS-B / Mode S domain types, shared by the native engine, the wire protocol
//! and the UI (native + WASM). Pure data + serde — the demodulator and the
//! frame decoder live in the native `sdroxide-adsb` crate.
//!
//! # Why an aircraft table rather than a message log
//!
//! 1090 MHz is a room full of transmitters repeating themselves: an airliner
//! sends its position twice a second, its velocity twice a second and its
//! callsign every five. A chronological log of every squitter is the same
//! twenty aircraft over and over, and the question an operator actually has is
//! "what is in the air, and where".
//!
//! So the decoder keeps one [`AdsbAircraft`] per ICAO address and re-sends the
//! whole table a couple of times a second, exactly as the ISM decoder re-sends
//! its device table. The address is the stable key that lets a panel row keep
//! its place and a map symbol keep its track.
//!
//! # The two clocks
//!
//! A target has two independent ages, because "I have not heard where it is"
//! and "I have not heard it at all" are different facts and want different
//! answers. [`AdsbSettings::drop_map_s`] governs the first: past it the target
//! leaves the map and its row greys, because a symbol drawn at a position that
//! is half a minute old is a lie told in the same ink as the truth.
//! [`AdsbSettings::drop_list_s`] governs the second: past it the aircraft is
//! gone.
