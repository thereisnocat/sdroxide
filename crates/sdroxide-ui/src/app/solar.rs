//! What the solar-system 3D view takes from the main window.
//!
//! The 3D view runs in its own viewport with its own state (see
//! [`crate::solar3d`]) and cannot borrow [`SdroxideApp`], so the traffic layer
//! it draws — who is being heard on the digital modes right now — is built
//! here each frame and handed over by value.
//!
//! Band conditions go the other way, and are here for that reason: they are the
//! one piece of space weather the *main* window shows, so the main window keeps
//! them current itself rather than waiting for the 3D view to be opened.
