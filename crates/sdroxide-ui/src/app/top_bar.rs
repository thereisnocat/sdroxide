//! in the order they appear: frequency, S-meter, VFO/RIT, band and mode,
//! RX filter, sub-RX, TX, the skimmer and display popups, and the window
//! buttons. Each pushes [`Command`]s rather than touching the controller, so
//! the whole strip is a pure function of the state it draws from.
//!
//! Only the desktop draws that full strip, and it lays it out itself rather
//! than letting a wrapping row break wherever a box happens not to fit: every
//! box is one uniform height with its controls in up to two rows, every width
//! is measured before anything is drawn, [`plan_top_strip`] picks the row
//! breaks that come out balanced, and each row's leftover goes to the boxes
//! that can use it — the S-meter widens, sliders lengthen, chips spread — so
//! the strip meets the right edge instead of leaving a ragged gap there.
//!
//! A tablet keeps the readout and the S-meter at full size and folds
//! everything else into menus; a phone stacks a compact readout, the meter and
//! one row of menu chips. And a tablet-tier window too *short* for even two
//! stacked rows — a 1280x720 panel — gets the single-row strip: the VFO box
//! (a type-in readout over an S-meter bar) beside a thumb-sized PTT and two
