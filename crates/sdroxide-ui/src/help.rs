//! F1 help: the embedded user manual, rendered as cyberpunk markdown with a
//! separately-scrollable navigation outline on the left.
//!
//! The manual text and every screenshot are baked into the binary with
//! `include_str!` / `include_bytes!`, so the help window works with no files
//! on disk (and in the wasm build). A small hand-rolled markdown parser turns
//! the manual into a block list once, then the window renders it with angled,
//! hazard-striped section headers to match the rest of the UI chrome.
//!
//! Across the top is a find bar that searches as you type: every occurrence is
//! highlighted where it is drawn, ◀/▶ (or Enter / F3) step through them, and
//! the CONTENTS rows holding a hit are tinted and badged with their count, so
//! a term that appears in one chapter out of eleven is visible before any
//! scrolling happens.
