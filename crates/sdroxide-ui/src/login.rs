//! The sign-in screen a server that asks for a password puts up.
//!
//! Drawn *instead of* the radio rather than over it. There is nothing to draw
//! behind it — no capabilities, no state and no spectrum arrive until the
//! server accepts — and a screen full of empty meters with a dialog on top
//! would only invite the belief that the radio is there and unresponsive.
//!
//! Shared by both clients: the main window and, in the browser, the
//! solar-system tab, which is challenged by the same server for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! A station serves each of its radios on a connection of its own, and asks
//! each one for a password — so a client holding a whole station would face
//! one sign-in per radio. It does not: an answer a station has *accepted* is
//! kept for as long as the program runs ([`SESSION_LOGINS`]) and offered to
//! every other connection to that same station, so the operator signs in once
//! and the rest of the tabs let themselves in. Ticking "remember" is the
//! separate, longer-lived decision to keep it on this device between runs.
//!
//! Those automatic sign-ins go in one at a time ([`SIGNING_IN`]), because that
//! is the only rate a station will judge them at: it compares one answer at a
//! time and tells everybody else to come back. A station of four radios whose
//! four tabs all answered on the same frame would have three of them turned
//! away — and a tab that is not the one on screen never draws a card, so there
//! is nobody there to try again. The gate, and treating that "come back" as
//! the non-verdict it is ([`sdroxide_types::is_auth_busy`]), are what keep the
//! rest of the station's tabs from arriving at a challenge they cannot answer.
