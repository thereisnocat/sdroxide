//! GPU waterfall: a ring-buffer history texture scrolled/panned/zoomed in the

//!
//! WebGL2-downlevel-safe by design: no compute, no storage buffers, only
//! sampled R8Unorm/RGBA8 textures and one uniform buffer.
//!
//! The renderer's `CallbackResources` type-map holds exactly one value per
//! type, shared by every viewport — so the resources here are a *registry*:
//! pipelines, layouts and samplers built once, plus one set of history
//! textures per radio, keyed by [`WaterfallCallback::wf_id`]. Two radio tabs
//! writing one shared history would corrupt each other's scrollback and fight
//! over the frequency axis on every switch.
