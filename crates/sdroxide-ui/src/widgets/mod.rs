/// three lines, and egui then smears whichever it was over several frames of
/// `smooth_scroll_delta`. Counting points there tuned three steps for one
/// notch in a browser and one and a third natively, so the raw events are
/// counted instead — one event is one detent, whichever way it points.
///
/// Fine-grained scrolling is the exception, and the reason for the bank. A
/// trackpad, or a high-resolution wheel reporting a notch in pieces, arrives
/// as a stream of deltas far smaller than a notch; those add up in `acc` until
/// they are worth a whole step, so a slow scroll still tunes instead of being
/// thrown away.
///
/// With `shift` — egui's horizontal-scroll modifier, and what macOS reports a
/// shifted wheel on to begin with — either axis counts, so the gesture is not
/// dead on the platforms that move it sideways.
