//! S-meter with three selectable faces: an analog needle instrument (the
//! default), a horizontal bar, and a scrolling trace of the last fifteen
//! seconds. All three are clickable — the caller cycles the face on a click —
//! and all three switch to a TX meter while transmitting, where the headline
//! reading is SWR on its own logarithmic scale, drawn as a real meter rather
//! than a number.
//!
//! The three share their scales, colour ramps and header, so a reading looks
//! the same wherever it is shown; only the visualisation differs.
//!
//! The meter fills its whole box edge-to-edge: it paints its own instrument
//! face over the full allocated rect and draws the box border on top, so there
//! is no padding between the instrument and the frame.
//!
//! Everything is laid out against `k`, the box height over its 72 px design
//! height, so the whole instrument scales with the box it is handed.
