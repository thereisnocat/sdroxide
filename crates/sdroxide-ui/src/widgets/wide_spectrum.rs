//! The full-band strip: everything a direct-sampling receiver can see at once,
//! as a scrolling waterfall.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* a second [`crate::widgets::spectrum_view`]. That widget is
//! two thousand lines of panadapter — filter-edge grips, sub-receiver dragging,
//! fling, zoom, viewport negotiation with the engine — all of it pinned to the
//! device passband through `ViewState::clamp_to`. None of that applies here: the
//! span is fixed at whatever the front end can see, there is nothing to zoom
//! into, and the two interactions that matter are "take me there" and "how wide
//! is that" — a click tunes, and shift+drag measures a span with the
//! panadapter's own ruler.
//!
//! Overloading `state.sample_rate` to describe this wider window instead would
//! have avoided a new widget and broken two things that read it as the real IQ
//! span: `keep_vfo_in_span`, which would then never retune, and the sub-receiver
//! clamp, which would let the sub be placed somewhere the DDC cannot reach.
//!
//! # Why this waterfall is on the CPU
//!
//! [`crate::waterfall_gpu`] keeps its state in egui's *type-keyed*
//! `CallbackResources`, so a second instance needs a newtype and another pair of
//! 2048×2048 textures — 8 MB — to show a strip a few dozen rows tall. This one
//! rebuilds a 1024×120 image twenty times a second, which is not worth a second
//! GPU pipeline.
