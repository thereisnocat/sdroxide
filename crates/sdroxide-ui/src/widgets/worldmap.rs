//! A small pixel/dot-matrix world map for the FT8 QSO panel: renders the
//! continents as glowing dots — with their borders, their rivers and the
//! cities that fit — and marks the home + DX locations with a great-circle
//! path between them, cyberpunk style.
//!
//! The ground under it all comes from [`crate::basemap`], which is the same
//! Natural Earth data the 3D globe is textured with. That is deliberate: the
//! two views have to agree about where a shoreline is, and one set of assets
//! for both is how they do. The land arrives as a coverage raster and the lines
//! as the polylines they were digitised as — the two halves of the map that
//! want opposite things from their data.
//!
//! The map is centred on the operator's home grid (the world wraps around it
//! rather than being shifted) and smoothly auto-zooms to frame home plus every
//! decoded station, re-fitting whenever new stations appear.
//!
//! The auto-fit is a starting point, not a cage: drag (or one finger) pans,
//! wheel and pinch zoom about the pointer, and a double-click hands the view
//! back to the auto-fit.
