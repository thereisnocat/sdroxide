//! The station's shared-device registry: one physical device, many radios.
//!
//! A multi-stream device — a TCI rig with two receivers, later an HPSDR
//! board's DDCs or a Pluto's second chain — carries one *connection* that
//! several radio tabs draw streams from. Whichever radio opens first creates
//! the connection; the others attach to it. The registry is how they find it:
//! keyed by the device's identity, holding a [`Weak`] so it never keeps a
//! device alive by itself — the sources' own `Arc`s do that, and dropping the
//! last one closes the connection. Releasing one radio's stream therefore
//! never tears down another's.
//!
//! Lives in the binary, like the backends themselves: the engine stays free
//! of process globals, and each engine's [`sdroxide_radio::ReopenFn`] simply
//! calls in here. The one lock also serializes two engines' reconnect workers
//! racing to revive the same dead rig — the first one reopens, the second
//! finds the fresh entry and attaches.
