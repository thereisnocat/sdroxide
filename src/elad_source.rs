//! An [`IqSource`] for an ELAD FDM-DUO, FDM-S2 or FDM-S1: wideband I/Q over
//! the native USB driver in `sdroxide-elad`, rig control over the transceiver's
//! CAT port, and transmit audio out through its USB sound card.
//!
//! # One radio, three USB devices
//!
//! An FDM-DUO enumerates three times — ELAD's own vendor interface for the
//! DDC's I/Q, an FTDI bridge for CAT, and a C-Media sound card — and this file
//! is where the three become one interface. That shape is why the pieces here
//! are borrowed rather than rebuilt: `sdroxide_cat` already drives the serial
//! link (with [`CatFamily::Elad`], the same profile `Backend::Cat` uses) and
//! `sdroxide_audio` already carries transmit audio, so what is left is the
//! joining.
//!
//! An FDM-S1 or FDM-S2 has only the first of the three and comes up
//! receive-only, with no control path at all.
//!
//! # The centre is the dial, because on this radio they are one knob
//!
//! This front end hands over a whole DDC window — 192 kHz at the least — but
//! what that window is centred *on* is the transceiver's own VFO. The DDC is
//! not a second receiver alongside the one the radio tunes for itself: move the
//! VFO and the window moves with it, hertz for hertz. There is therefore no
//! arrangement in which the radio's displayed frequency and sdroxide's dial can
//! be different numbers and both be true, so [`IqSource::center_is_dial`] says
//! so and the engine commands the VFO for every tune, exactly as it does for a
//! transceiver sending I/Q down a sound card ([`crate::audio_cat_source`]).
//!
//! CW is the one exception, and it is not really one. The window still rides the
//! VFO — that is the point — but sdroxide's CW dial is a zero-beat and the tone
//! being copied sits a sidetone pitch above it, while the DUO keys its own
//! transmitter on the VFO. So there the VFO goes on the station and the dial
//! stays a pitch under it: [`IqSource::cw_iq_on_vfo`] is this radio saying which
//! of the two CW families it belongs to, and the engine's `rig_cw_offset_hz` is
//! what it costs. Leaving the two equal answered every station a sidetone low
//! ([issue #170]).
//!
//! It used to be the other way round — the VFO was parked on the panadapter
//! centre and the dial moved inside the window in software — and every way that
//! could go wrong, did. The rig's display never agreed with sdroxide's readout;
//! the radio's own audio was demodulating the centre rather than the station
//! being listened to; an over keyed at the *radio* (mic, key, VOX) went out on
//! the centre, which is up to half a window from where the operator could see
//! they were tuned; and a tuning step smaller than half the window commanded
//! nothing at all, so the dial and the mouse wheel simply did not move the
//! radio ([issue #146]).
//!
//! What must **not** come back with that is [issue #111]: the receive dial used
//! to be pushed at the VFO through [`IqSource::set_tx_freq_hz`], which slid the
//! window underneath a panadapter that believed it had not moved, so the station
//! clicked on ran away across the screen instead of being tuned. That hook stays
//! a no-op. The window moves only through [`IqSource::set_center_hz`], which is
//! the one path the engine also relabels the frequency axis from.
//!
//! An FDM-S1 or FDM-S2 has no VFO to command and is an ordinary SDR: its centre
//! is its LO, and the engine tunes inside the span. So is an FDM-DUO whose
//! control port never answered — commanding a dial nothing is listening to is
//! how the panadapter comes to look locked (issue #155), so the claim is made
//! only once the radio has been heard from.
//!

//! # Not verified against hardware
//!
//! Almost nothing here has been run against a radio. One of the two assumptions
//! this file was written on has now been settled the hard way, by an operator
//! with an FDM-DUO: the DDC feeding this USB interface is emphatically *not*
//! independent of the receiver the transceiver tunes for its own audio. The
//! other still wants checking — whether the stream survives a transmit cycle.
//! It is assumed *not* to (the interface is declared half duplex), which is the
//! safe way to be wrong.
