//! An [`IqSource`] for a HackRF driven over USB by the native driver in
//! `sdroxide-hackrf` — no SoapySDR, no libusb, no libhackrf.
//!
//! The first native USB backend here that transmits, and it is half duplex:
//! receive stops for the length of an over. Two consequences show up in this
//! file rather than in the driver.
//!
//! **Drive stays digital.** [`IqSource::set_tx_drive`] and `set_tune_drive` are
//! left at their trait defaults, which looks like an omission and is not. The
//! engine applies drive to the samples unconditionally (`engine.rs:7205-7215`)
//! and only consults `commands_tx_power()` on the *audio* path
//! (`engine.rs:7338`), so a source that claimed power control and mapped drive
//! onto the transmit VGA would be attenuated twice — exactly what the trait
//! warns about at `source.rs:194-200`. The VGA is published as an ordinary
//! transmit gain element instead, which the generic slider drives and the
//! engine remembers across a reopen.
//!
//! **The transmitter is off unless it is armed.** `HackRfConfig::tx_enabled`
//! decides whether `hackrf_caps` publishes a transmit channel at all; with it
//! off, the engine's own capability check refuses to key. See `main.rs`.
