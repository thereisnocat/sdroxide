//! An [`IqSource`] for a KiwiSDR or Web-888.
//!
//! Two lanes from one session, and the split is the same one
//! [`crate::spyserver_source`] makes in its VFO interface — for the same
//! reason, and here with no alternative at all. A KiwiSDR has no wideband I/Q
//! to offer: what it has is a ~12 kHz user channel, which it will hand over as
//! complex baseband instead of as audio, and a 1024-bin picture of its whole
//! 0–30 MHz band. So the main panadapter is 12 kHz and honest about it, and the
//! strip above it is the receiver's own waterfall, reaching the engine through
//! [`IqSource::wide_spectrum_db`] — the seam an Icom's scope sweep and the
//! RX-888's full band already use.
//!
//! Tuning across the strip works because the engine notices the VFO has left
//! the received slice and retunes, which here means the receiver slides its
//! channel along. Deliberately *not* [`IqSource::center_is_dial`]: that flag is
//! for a front end whose centre is some rig's dial, one synthesiser doing both
//! jobs, and there is no rig here — only a window this end places. The
//! `SpyServerVfo` interface leaves it false for exactly the same reason.
//!
//! # The S-meter comes off the wire, not out of the samples
//!
//! The receiver's AGC sits ahead of the I/Q, and it is on by default because
//! the measured alternative was worse (see [`KiwiConfig::agc`]). That makes the
//! sample amplitude a measurement of the AGC as much as of the signal, so
//! [`IqSource::rx_signal_dbm`] hands over the figure the receiver puts in every
//! audio frame instead. It is already in dBm on its operator's own calibration,
//! which is why the engine returns it without applying `cal_offset_db`.
//!
//! One honest caveat: that figure is for the receiver's own ±6 kHz passband,
//! not for whatever filter sdroxide has in front of the demodulator. A narrow
//! CW filter here still reads the wideband level.
//!
//! # Receive only
//!
//! Not a missing feature. These are other people's antennas, and the trait's
//! transmit methods already default to errors.
