//! An [`IqSource`] for a LimeSDR driven through LimeSuite by `sdroxide-lime`,
//! and the LimeRFE in front of it.
//!
//! # No thread
//!
//! Unlike the native USB backends this one calls the library straight from the
//! engine's thread. That is not an omission: LimeSuite already runs its own USB
//! workers behind its own FIFO, and `LMS_RecvStream` takes a timeout, so the
//! shape here is the SoapySDR source's — one `read_within` called with 200 ms
//! from [`IqSource::read`] and zero from [`IqSource::read_available`]. Stacking
//! a second ring on top would add latency and buy nothing.
//!
//! # Drive stays digital
//!
//! [`IqSource::set_tx_drive`] is left at its trait default and
//! `commands_tx_power` stays false, for the reason spelled out in
//! `hackrf_source.rs`: the engine already applies drive to the samples, so a
//! source that also mapped it onto the transmit gain would attenuate twice.
//! The gain is published as an ordinary transmit element instead.
//!
//! # Where the LimeRFE band-follow hooks in
//!
//! Two signals, and the receive one is not obvious. [`IqSource::set_tx_freq_hz`]
//! is the transmit side and exists for exactly this — its doc names
//! band-switching amplifiers as the case it was written for. The receive side
//! is **not** `set_center_hz` alone: this is a zero-IF radio, so the engine
//! parks the LO a quarter-span above the dial, and near a band edge that is the
//! difference between the right filter and the wrong one. The operator's actual
//! receive frequency is `centre + if_offset`, and `set_if_offset` is what
//! carries the second term.
