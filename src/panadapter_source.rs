//! Two radios behaving as one: a transceiver that is controlled and keyed, and
//! a second receiver that supplies the spectrum.
//!
//! The arrangement this exists for is a station whose transceiver has no
//! wideband output — CAT on a serial port, demodulated audio on a sound card —
//! beside an SDR fed from the same antenna or from the rig's I.F. socket. On its
//! own the rig can only show a slice of its audio band mapped to RF; with the
//! SDR's I/Q underneath it, the same tab gets a real panadapter, a waterfall, a
//! sub receiver, digital modes and a skimmer, while every control that matters —
//! the dial, the mode, the filter, PTT, the keyer — stays with the transceiver.
//!
//! # Why a source rather than a link between two engines
//!
//! [`IqSource`] already separates *where the samples come from* from *what
//! drives the radio*: `poll_control`, `set_control_mode`, `set_control_filter`,
//! `rx_signal_dbm`, the CW text keyer and the whole transmit half are there for
//! front ends that are transceivers. Nothing says both halves have to be the
//! same device. Implementing the trait across two of them means the engine, and
//! therefore the panadapter's pan and zoom bounds, the sub-receiver clamp,
//! `keep_vfo_in_span`, every remote client and the browser, all see an ordinary
//! wideband radio — with no code anywhere else that knows about the pairing.
//!
//! The consequence is that the attached receiver's device belongs to this
//! source. It cannot also be running as a radio of its own, which is why
//! `boot_radios` skips it.
//!
//! # The frequency algebra
//!
//! One number: `off`, the offset the receiver sits above the dial, which
//! [`PanadapterConfig::offset_for`] may make depend on the mode. Everything the
//! engine is told is on the *dial's* scale and everything the receiver is told
//! is on its own:
//!
//! - `center_hz()` reports `rx.center_hz() - off` — where the receiver's centre
//!   lands on the dial. Reported from what the receiver actually achieved, so a
//!   front end that can only tune in 1 kHz steps needs no correction here: the
//!   engine's DDC absorbs the remainder as it does for any other radio.
//! - `set_center_hz(hz)` tunes the receiver to `hz + off`.
//! - `set_if_offset(o)` is how the transceiver's dial moves. The engine pushes
//!   `vfo - center` through it on every retune, which is the one place the VFO
//!   itself can be reconstructed — `set_center_hz` only ever says where the span
//!   should sit.
//!
//! With an I.F. tap the receiver is not really being tuned at all: it watches a
//! fixed intermediate frequency while the rig's own first oscillator moves the
//! band underneath it. That falls out of the same arithmetic — `off` changes
//! with the dial by construction — so it needs no separate mode here, only an
//! offset the size of an I.F. and, on rigs whose carrier moves with the mode, a
//! per-mode override.
