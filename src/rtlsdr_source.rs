//! An [`IqSource`] for an RTL2832U dongle driven by the native driver in
//! `sdroxide-rtlsdr` — no SoapySDR, no libusb.
//!
//! Two ways in, one source: [`RtlSdrSource::open`] takes a dongle on this
//! machine's USB bus, [`RtlSdrSource::connect`] one published over the network
//! by an `rtl_tcp` server. Everything below the constructors is shared,
//! because it is the same radio and the same samples — only the distance to
//! its registers differs.
//!
//! Receive only: the trait's transmit methods already default to errors, which
//! is the correct answer for this hardware.
