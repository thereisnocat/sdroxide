//! An [`IqSource`] for an RX-888 Mk2 driven over USB by the native driver in
//! `sdroxide-rx888` — no SoapySDR, no libusb, and no vendor driver package.
//!
//! Receive only: the trait's transmit methods already default to errors, which
//! is the correct answer for a receiver.
//!
//! # What this source is doing that the others are not
//!
//! The hardware has no downconverter. It sends 16-bit *real* samples at the full
//! ADC rate — 64.8 Msps covering 0–32.4 MHz at the default clock — and an FFT
//! downconverter in the backend turns a selectable slice of that into complex
//! baseband: 1/32 of the clock by default, up to the whole half-spectrum in the
//! panadapter at once. Three consequences leak out here:
//!
//! * [`IqSource::sample_rate`] is the *downconverter's* output rate, not the
//!   ADC clock. The engine's own DDC chain then works from that as usual.
//! * Retuning is free. There is no LO to move and no I2C to wait for — a retune
//!   is a change of FFT bin — so dragging the panadapter across the whole of HF
//!   costs nothing.
//! * The downconverter's centre cannot go everywhere the dial can: it clamps to
//!   what keeps the output inside the half-spectrum, and the wider the output
//!   the larger the strip of dial it cannot centre on. Where that happens the
//!   achieved centre is reported through [`IqSource::poll_control`] — see
//!   [`achieved_center_hz`].
