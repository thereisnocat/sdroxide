//! An [`IqSource`] for a receiver published by a SpyServer.
//!
//! Two ways in, one source: [`SpyServerSource::connect_wideband`] asks for one
//! I/Q stream at a stage of the server's ladder, the way every other SDR here
//! delivers; [`SpyServerSource::connect_vfo`] asks for a *narrow* one that
//! follows the dial, and leans on the server's own FFT for the band view.
//! Everything below the constructors is shared, because it is the same server
//! and the same samples — only how much of the band arrives as I/Q differs.
//!
//! # Two lanes, on purpose
//!
//! The FFT stream reaches the engine through
//! [`IqSource::wide_spectrum_db`] — the same seam the RX-888's full band and
//! an Icom's own scope already use — and *not* through `sample_rate`. That
//! matters: `sample_rate` is what the DDC, the sub-receiver clamp and
//! `keep_vfo_in_span` are all built on, and a value describing a span the
//! receiver cannot actually demodulate would break each of them in a different
//! way. So the main panadapter is what the I/Q covers, honestly, and the strip
//! above it is what the server drew.
//!
//! The consequence in the VFO interface is deliberate and worth knowing about:
//! the main panadapter is a few tens of kHz wide, and the whole band lives in
//! the strip. Tuning across the strip works because the engine notices the new
//! frequency is outside the received slice and retunes — which here means the
//! server slides its narrow window along.
//!
//! Receive only: the trait's transmit methods already default to errors, which
//! is the correct answer for a receiver on the other side of a network.
